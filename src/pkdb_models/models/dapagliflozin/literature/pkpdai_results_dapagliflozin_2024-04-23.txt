TI  - Bioequivalence of fixed-dose combinations of dapagliflozin and metformin with 
      single-component tablets in healthy subjects and the effect of food on 
      bioavailability.
PG  - 118-30

AB  - The pharmacokinetics (PK) of dapagliflozin and metformin administered as 
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets (2.5 mg dapagliflozin/850 mg metformin or 
      5 mg dapagliflozin/1000 mg metformin) or as separate tablets in healthy subjects 
      were evaluated in 2 separate studies. Study 1 evaluated PK by measuring mean 
      ratios of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (time zero to infinity 
      [AUCinf ]), AUC from zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC0-t ), and 
      maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax ) for single-component or FDC tablets 
      following a non-high-fat meal. Mean ratios of AUCinf , AUC0-t , and Cmax for FDC 
      or single-component dapagliflozin and metformin tablets were close to unity. In 
      study 2, AUCinf , AUC0-t , and Cmax for the FDC tablet were obtained fasting and 
      after a high-fat meal. Dapagliflozin 5 mg and metformin 1000 mg geometric mean 
      Cmax was increased in the fasted versus fed state (61.9 vs 43.9 and 1600 vs 
      1330 ng/mL, respectively), but AUC0-t was similar (267 and 265 and 11 000 and 
      10 600 ng · h/mL, respectively). In summary, FDC tablets were bioequivalent to 
      single-component tablets, and total absorption (AUC) was similar for non-high-fat 
      and high-fat meals.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin, a novel sodium-glucose 
      transporter 2 inhibitor, and metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride or sitagliptin 
      in healthy subjects.
PG  - 47-54

AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by selectively inhibiting 
      renal sodium-glucose transporter 2, an insulin-independent mechanism of action 
      that may be complementary to that of other oral antidiabetes drugs. The current 
      studies assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between 
      dapagliflozin and pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin in healthy 
      subjects following single-dose administration. METHODS: In open-label, 
      randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover studies, 24 subjects received 
      50 mg dapagliflozin, 45 mg pioglitazone or the combination, while 18 subjects 
      received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 1000 mg metformin or the combination. In an 
      open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover study, 
      18 subjects first received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 4 mg glimepiride or the 
      combination, and afterward 100 mg sitagliptin or sitagliptin plus 20 mg 
      dapagliflozin. Blood samples were taken over 72 h of each treatment period. Lack 
      of PK interaction was defined as the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence 
      interval (CI) for combination:monotherapy being within the range of 0.80-1.25. 
      RESULTS: Co-administration of dapagliflozin with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin had no effect on dapagliflozin maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max) ) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). 
      Similarly, dapagliflozin did not affect the C(max) or AUC for the co-administered 
      drug, except for slight extensions of the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means 
      for glimepiride AUC (upper limit 1.29) and pioglitazone C(max) (lower limit 
      0.75). All monotherapies and combination therapies were well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin can be co-administered with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin without dose adjustment of either drug.

AB  - Dapagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter type 2 that is being developed for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. This open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment (single 
      doses of 10-mg dapagliflozin fasted or fed), crossover study was conducted to 
      evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin 
      in 14 healthy subjects. Compared to the fasted state, a high-fat meal decreased 
      mean dapagliflozin maximum plasma concentrations (C(max) ) by 31%, increased the 
      time to C(max) (T(max) ) by 1 h, but did not affect overall dapagliflozin 
      systemic exposure [area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)]. As the 
      cumulative (daily) amount of glucose excreted in the urine induced by 
      dapagliflozin is dependent upon dapagliflozin AUC, the effect of food on 
      dapagliflozin C(max) is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on 
      dapagliflozin's efficacy. On the basis of these findings, dapagliflozin can be 
      administered without regard to meals.

TI  - Impact of voglibose on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in Japanese patients 
      with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 41-9
LID - 10.1007/s13300-012-0016-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dapagliflozin is an orally administered selective sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor under development for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin lowers blood glucose through a reduction 
      in renal glucose reabsorption. This study was performed to assess the effect of 
      the oral antidiabetic agent voglibose [0.2 mg thrice daily (t.i.d.)] at 
      steady-state, on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin 
      administered as a single oral dose (10 mg) to Japanese patients with T2DM. 
      METHODS: This was an open-label, multi-center, drug-drug interaction study. A 
      single oral dose of dapagliflozin (10 mg) was administered to 22 Japanese 
      patients with T2DM in the presence and absence of voglibose (0.2 mg t.i.d.). 
      Serial blood samples were collected before and at regular prespecified intervals 
      after each dapagliflozin dose to determine dapagliflozin plasma concentrations 
      and to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on a mixed effect analysis of 
      variance model, including the dosing condition as a fixed effect and patients as 
      a random effect, the ratios of geometric means of area under curve from time 0 to 
      infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) with and 
      without voglibose were estimated along with two-sided 90% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). RESULTS: In Japanese patients with T2DM, the exposure to dapagliflozin 
      following a single oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg was not influenced by the 
      concomitant administration of voglibose (0.2 mg t.i.d.). The geometric ratio (90% 
      CI) for dapagliflozin AUC0-inf with/without voglibose was 1.009 (0.954, 1.067), 
      and for C max 1.040 (0.899, 1.204). The median time to C max (t max) and plasma 
      clearance of dapagliflozin were also similar between treatments. The mean 
      half-life (t ½) for dapagliflozin was slightly higher when administered in 
      combination with voglibose. Dapagliflozin 10 mg was well tolerated when 
      administered alone and in combination with voglibose in Japanese patients with 
      T2DM. CONCLUSION: The results presented here support the co-administration of 
      dapagliflozin and voglibose without dose adjustment of either agent.

TI  - Lack of a Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between Saxagliptin and Dapagliflozin in 
      Healthy Subjects: A Randomized Crossover Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: This single-dose, open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment 
      crossover drug-drug interaction study was conducted to evaluate differences in 
      the pharmacokinetic properties of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin when 
      coadministered. METHODS: Healthy subjects (N = 42) were randomized to receive 
      saxagliptin 5 mg alone, dapagliflozin 10 mg alone, or saxagliptin 5 mg plus 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg coadministered; there was a washout period of ≥6 days between 
      treatments. Serial blood samples for determining saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy 
      saxagliptin (5-OH saxagliptin; major active metabolite) and dapagliflozin plasma 
      concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters were collected before and up to 60 
      hours after the dose. No interaction was to be concluded if the 90% CIs for the 
      geometric mean ratios of the combination compared with each drug given alone for 
      Cmax and AUCinf were within 0.80 to 1.25. FINDINGS: The results indicated that 
      dapagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of saxagliptin, 
      5-OH saxagliptin, or saxagliptin total active moiety and vice versa. The 90% CIs 
      for Cmax and AUCinf for all comparisons were contained entirely within the 0.80 
      to 1.25 equivalence intervals. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (apparent oral 
      clearance or half-life) of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin were similar when each 
      medicine was administered alone or when coadministered. No safety profile or 
      tolerability findings of concern were observed during the study. All adverse 
      events were mild, and no serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: 
      These data indicate that coadministration of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin 
      exhibits no pharmacokinetic interaction and is well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics and the exposure-response relationship of 
      dapagliflozin between adolescent/young adult and adult patients with type 1 
      diabetes mellitus.

AB  - AIMS: To quantitatively compare pharmacokinetics (PK) and the exposure-response 
      (ER) relationship of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, 
      between adolescents/young adults and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 
      METHODS: Data from 2 clinical studies for dapagliflozin were analysed using a 
      non-linear mixed-effects approach. The PK and the relationship between 
      dapagliflozin exposure and response (24-hour urinary glucose excretion) were 
      characterized. PK was evaluated using a 2-compartment model with first-order 
      absorption while the exposure response-relationship was analysed using a 
      sigmoidal maximal-effect model. The 24-hour median blood glucose, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), sex, age and body weight were evaluated as 
      covariates. RESULTS: A 2-compartment model with first order absorption provided a 
      reasonable fit to the dapagliflozin PK data. Body weight was found to be a 
      significant covariate on dapagliflozin exposure. The ER relationship was best 
      described by a sigmoidal maximal effect model with 24-hour median blood glucose 
      and eGFR as significant covariates on maximal effect. In accordance with the 
      observed data, model-predicted urinary glucose excretion response following 10 mg 
      dapagliflozin dose was higher in the study in adolescents/young adults 
      (138.0 g/24 h) compared to adults (70.5 g/24 h) with T1DM. This is linked to 
      higher eGFR and 24-hour median blood glucose in this trial. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dapagliflozin PK and ER relationship were similar in the 2 analysed studies after 
      accounting for covariate effects. These results suggest that no dose adjustment 
      is required for adolescent patients with T1DM.

AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin, a selective, orally active inhibitor of the renal 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) is in development for the treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of dapagliflozin were evaluated in healthy Japanese 
      subjects and in Japanese subjects with T2DM. METHODS: Two studies were conducted: 
      a single-ascending dose (SAD) study (2.5-50 mg) in 32 healthy subjects and a 
      multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study (2.5-20 mg QD for 14 days) in 36 subjects 
      with T2DM. Safety and tolerability were assessed in both studies. Single and 
      multiple dose PK of dapagliflozin and its inactive major metabolite, 
      dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, and PD (urinary glucose parameters) were 
      characterized. Plasma glucose parameters were assessed over 14 days in the MAD 
      study. RESULTS: No serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse 
      events occurred in either study. In healthy and T2DM subjects, dapagliflozin was 
      rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 0.5-1.3 h. 
      Systemic exposure of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, measured by 
      maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, 
      increased proportional to dose. On a molar basis, systemic exposure to 
      dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was similar to parent dapagliflozin. There was a 
      dose-related increase in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine (SAD and 
      MAD), which was associated with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose 
      parameters in subjects with T2DM (MAD). CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well 
      tolerated and showed predictable dose-proportional PK and PD parameters in both 
      healthy and T2DM Japanese subjects.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety 
      profile of dapagliflozin in paediatric patients aged 10-17 years with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Patients were randomized to a single oral dose 
      of dapagliflozin 2.5, 5 or 10 mg. The PK characteristics for individual patients 
      were derived by non-compartmental methods. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE), 
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and ease of swallowing were also evaluated. RESULTS: 
      A total of 24 patients with a mean (range) body weight of 99.7 (61.5-169.5) kg 
      received dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed after oral 
      administration (median time to maximum plasma concentration ∼1.5 h) and systemic 
      exposures to dapagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite appeared 
      dose-proportional. The mean 24-h UGE increased in a dose-related manner (52.8, 
      62.4 and 89.0 g for the 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). Mean FPG 
      concentrations were lower for all dose groups on day 2 (6.9, 6.2 and 6.8 mmol/l 
      for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively) than they were predose on day 1 (9.5, 
      8.5 and 8.2 mmol/l for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). Six patients (25%) 
      experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), however, there was no dose-related pattern. 
      All AEs occurred only once and most were mild in intensity. Nearly all patients 
      (n = 23; 95.8%) reported easy swallowing of the dapagliflozin tablets. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well tolerated in this paediatric population, with 
      no significant safety findings. PK/PD characteristics were similar to those 
      observed in adults with T2DM, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the same 
      dapagliflozin dosage as that used in adults can be evaluated in future phase III 
      paediatric studies.

TI  - Influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of 
      dapagliflozin: an open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study.
PG  - 1798-808
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.09.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of renal sodium glucose 
      co-transporter 2, is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Dapagliflozin elimination is primarily via glucuronidation to an 
      inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Pharmacokinetic studies are 
      recommended in subjects with impaired hepatic function if hepatic metabolism 
      accounts for a substantial portion of the absorbed drug. OBJECTIVE: The purpose 
      of our study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in patients 
      with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (HI) with healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: This was an open-label, parallel-group study in male or female patients 
      with mild, moderate, or severe HI (6 per group according to Child-Pugh 
      classification) and in 6 healthy control subjects. The control subjects were 
      matched to the combined HI group for age (±10 years), weight (±20%), sex, and 
      smoking status, with no deviations from normal in medical history, physical 
      examination, ECG, or laboratory determinations. All participants received a 
      single 10-mg oral dose of dapagliflozin, and the pharmacokinetics of 
      dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide were characterized. Dapagliflozin 
      tolerability was also assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Demographic 
      characteristics and baseline physical measurements (weight, height, and body mass 
      index) were similar among the 18 patients in the HI groups (58-126 kg; 
      151.2-190.0 cm, and 31.5-37.7 kg/m(2), respectively) and the healthy subject 
      group (65.0-102.6 kg; 166.0-184.0 cm, and 23.3-34.3 kg/m(2), respectively). In 
      those with mild, moderate, or severe HI, dapagliflozin mean C(max) values were 
      12% lower and 12% and 40% higher than healthy subjects, respectively. Mean 
      dapagliflozin AUC(0-∞) values were 3%, 36%, and 67% higher compared with healthy 
      subjects, respectively. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide mean C(max) values were 4% 
      and 58% higher and 14% lower in those with mild, moderate, or severe HI compared 
      with healthy subjects, respectively, and mean dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide 
      AUC(0-∞) values were 6%, 100%, and 30% higher compared with healthy subjects, 
      respectively. These values were highly dependent on the calculated creatinine 
      clearance of each group. All adverse events were mild or moderate, with no 
      imbalance in frequency between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy 
      subjects, systemic exposure to dapagliflozin in subjects with HI was correlated 
      with the degree of HI. Single 10-mg doses of dapagliflozin were generally well 
      tolerated by participants in this study. Due to the higher dapagliflozin 
      exposures in patients with severe HI, the benefit:risk ratio should be 
      individually assessed because the long-term safety profile and efficacy of 
      dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population.

TI  - In vitro characterization and pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin (BMS-512148), a 
      potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type II inhibitor, in animals and humans.

AB  - (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-(3-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-4-chlorophenyl)-6-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol 
      (dapagliflozin; BMS-512148) is a potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type II 
      inhibitor in animals and humans and is currently under development for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. The preclinical characterization of dapagliflozin, 
      to allow compound selection and prediction of pharmacological and dispositional 
      behavior in the clinic, involved Caco-2 cell permeability studies, cytochrome 
      P450 (P450) inhibition and induction studies, P450 reaction phenotyping, 
      metabolite identification in hepatocytes, and pharmacokinetics in rats, dogs, and 
      monkeys. Dapagliflozin was found to have good permeability across Caco-2 cell 
      membranes. It was found to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not a 
      significant P-gp inhibitor. Dapagliflozin was not found to be an inhibitor or an 
      inducer of human P450 enzymes. The in vitro metabolic profiles of dapagliflozin 
      after incubation with hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were 
      qualitatively similar. Rat hepatocyte incubations showed the highest turnover, 
      and dapagliflozin was most stable in human hepatocytes. Prominent in vitro 
      metabolic pathways observed were glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and 
      O-deethylation. Pharmacokinetic parameters for dapagliflozin in preclinical 
      species revealed a compound with adequate oral exposure, clearance, and 
      elimination half-life, consistent with the potential for single daily dosing in 
      humans. The pharmacokinetics in humans after a single dose of 50 mg of 
      [(14)C]dapagliflozin showed good exposure, low clearance, adequate half-life, and 
      no metabolites with significant pharmacological activity or toxicological 
      concern.

TI  - Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response Relationship of 
      Dapagliflozin in Patients without Diabetes and with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 517-525
LID - 10.1007/s40262-020-00956-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 
      inhibitor, was originally developed as an oral glucose-lowering drug for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Emerging data suggest that cardiovascular 
      and kidney benefits extend to patients without diabetes. Limited pharmacological 
      data are, however, available in patients without diabetes. We aimed to 
      characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of dapagliflozin in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Plasma samples were 
      collected in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial 
      (DIAMOND, NCT03190694, n = 53) that assessed the effects of 10 mg of 
      dapagliflozin in patients with a glomerular filtration rate ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m(2) 
      and proteinuria > 500 mg/day. Mixed-effects models were used to develop a 
      pharmacokinetic model and to evaluate the association between plasma exposure and 
      response. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations (n = 430 observations) from 48 patients 
      (mean age 50.8 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 57.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 
      median proteinuria 1115 mg/24 h) were best described using a two-compartment 
      model with first-order elimination. Apparent clearance and volume of distribution 
      were 11.7 (95% confidence interval 10.7-12.7) L/h and 44.9 (95% confidence 
      interval 39.0-50.9) L, respectively. Median dapagliflozin plasma exposure was 
      740.9 ng h/mL (2.5th-97.5th percentiles: 434.0-1615.3). Plasma exposure increased 
      with decreasing kidney function. Every 100-ng h/mL increment in dapagliflozin 
      plasma exposure was associated with a decrease in the urinary albumin:creatinine 
      ratio (β = - 2.8%, p = 0.01), glomerular filtration rate (β = - 0.5 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2), p < 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (β = - 0.4 mmHg, p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The dapagliflozin plasma concentration-time profile in patients with 
      non-diabetic kidney disease appears similar to the profile of patients with 
      diabetic kidney disease described in the literature. Furthermore, the plasma 
      exposure was associated with changes in risk markers for kidney disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin, a selective, orally active, renal sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 2 inhibitor, is under investigation as a treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin reduces hyperglycemia by 
      inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption and dose-dependently increasing urinary 
      glucose excretion, independent of insulin secretion or action. OBJECTIVES: These 
      studies assessed the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmaco 
      dynamic properties of dapagliflozin and its major inactive metabolite, 
      dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), in healthy subjects residing in China. 
      METHODS: In 2 identically designed, open-label, single- and multiple-dose studies 
      (n = 14 for both studies), healthy Chinese subjects were administered oral 
      dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg. In both studies, subjects received a single dose on day 
      1 (single-dose administration period) followed by 6 once-daily doses on days 5 to 
      10 (multiple-dose administration period). Pharmacokinetic parameters (plasma and 
      urinary dapagliflozin and D3OG), pharmacodynamic response (urinary glucose 
      excretion), and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed 
      the dapagliflozin 5-mg study, and 13 completed the dapagliflozin 10-mg study. 
      Baseline characteristics were balanced across the two studies: 9 versus 10 men; 
      mean age, 27.1 versus 28.9 years; mean weight, 62.8 versus 62.2 kg; and mean body 
      mass index, 23.0 versus 22.2 kg/m(2) in the dapagliflozin 5- and 10-mg studies, 
      respectively. In both doses, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed (T(max), ≤1.5 h), 
      accumulation (defined as the geometric mean ratio of AUC(τ) at day 10 to AUC(τ) 
      at day 1) after multiple dosing was minimal (<1.13 fold), and elimination 
      half-life was 10 to 12 h. D3OG showed a slightly longer median Tmax (≤2 h) but a 
      similar plasma concentration-time profile and half-life compared with 
      dapagliflozin. The majority of D3OG (up to 69.7% of the dapagliflozin dose) was 
      excreted in urine, while ≤1.9% of dapagliflozin was excreted unchanged in urine. 
      Over a 24-hour period and at steady state (day 10), urinary glucose excretion 
      values were 28.1 and 41.1 g with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively. 
      Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated; one dapagliflozin 10 mg-treated 
      subject discontinued the study because of a serious adverse event (bronchitis) 
      considered by the investigator as unrelated to dapagliflozin dosing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics following single- and 
      multiple-dose dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg oral administration in healthy Chinese 
      subjects were as predicted from previous studies and were similar to findings 
      observed in non-Chinese healthy subjects. Dapagliflozin dosing was well 
      tolerated. The clinically recommended dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg once daily is 
      expected to be appropriate in patients of Chinese ethnicity; results from an 
      efficacy and tolerability study in Chinese patients with T2DM are awaited.

      dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Participants received a single dose on day 1, and 
      were treated once daily from day 4 to day 17. RESULTS: Following oral 
      administration, janagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching C(max) at 2 hours. 
      The mean half-life (t(1/2) ) at steady state was approximately 21 to 23 hours. 
      There was no significant accumulation with multiple doses (accumulation 
      factor < 2). In participants treated with janagliflozin 25 mg, janagliflozin 
      50 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, change in mean 24-hour urinary glucose 
      excretion from baseline was 92.35, 94.17, 87.61 and 6.26 g after multiple doses, 
      and change in mean fasting plasma glucose level from baseline to day 17 was 
      -2.18, -2.66, -2.79 and 1.70%, respectively. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild 
      or moderate with no deaths, serious AEs, or discontinuations due to AEs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Single and multiple oral administration (14 days) of janagliflozin 
      25 mg and 50 mg exhibited favourable PK, PD and tolerability profiles in Chinese 
      people with T2DM, which were comparable to those of dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
      Janagliflozin 25 mg and 50 mg are recommended for further clinical investigation.

PG  - e42
LID - 10.1038/psp.2013.20 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in development for 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A semi-mechanistic population 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed for dapagliflozin and its inactive 
      metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG) with emphasis on renal and 
      hepatic contribution to dapagliflozin metabolism. Renal and hepatic impairment 
      decreased the clearance of dapagliflozin to D3OG and the clearance of D3OG. The 
      fraction of D3OG formed via the renal route decreased from 40-55% in subjects 
      with normal renal function (creatinine clearance (CLcr) > 80 ml/min) to 10% in 
      subjects with severe renal insufficiency (CLcr = 13 ml/min). The model-based 
      simulations suggested that the increase of systemic exposure (AUCss) of 
      dapagliflozin and D3OG was less than twofold in subjects with mild or moderate 
      renal impairment. This population modeling analysis presents a useful approach to 
      evaluate the impact of renal and hepatic function on the PK of dapagliflozin.CPT:

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Empagliflozin in Healthy Egyptian Volunteers Using 
      LC-MS/MS and Comparison with Other Ethnic Populations.
PG  - 2583

LID - 2583
AB  - The present study considered the pharmacokinetic evaluation of empagliflozin 
      after administration to Egyptian volunteers, and the results were compared with 
      other ethnic populations. The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining 
      racial subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies 
      and to assess potential subgroup differences. The design of the study was as an 
      open labeled, randomized, one treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic 
      study. The main pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were C(max), T(max), t(1/2), 
      elimination rate constant, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf). The insignificant difference 
      in pharmacokinetic parameters between Egyptians and white German subjects 
      suggests that no dose adjustment should be considered with administration of 
      25 mg empagliflozin to Egyptian population. A new LC-MS/MS method was developed 
      and validated, allowing sensitive estimation of empagliflozin (25-600 ng mL(-1)) 
      in human plasma using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). The method was 
      applied successfully on the underlying pharmacokinetic study with enhanced sample 
      preparation that involved liquid-liquid extraction. Multiple Reaction Monitoring 
      (MRM) of the transition pairs of m/z 449.01 to 371.21 for empagliflozin and m/z 
      407.00 to 328.81 for dapagliflozin (IS) was employed utilizing negative mode 
      Electro Spray Ionization (ESI). The validated LC-MS/MS method is suitable for 
      further toxicodynamic and bioequivalence studies.

TI  - Comparison of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in

PG  - 236-40
LID - 10.1111/dom.12594 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) versus type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) in order to explore the potential of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to 
      insulin in patients with T1DM. METHODS: Steady-state pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin (1-100 mg) were evaluated in a meta-analysis of 
      patients with T1DM or T2DM. A model was constructed of the relationship between 
      dapagliflozin systemic exposure and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients 
      with T1DM versus those with T2DM. RESULTS: Data were analysed from 160 patients 
      (T1DM, n = 70; T2DM, n = 90). Dapagliflozin systemic exposure (maximum 
      concentration and area under the curve) increased similarly in a dose-related 
      manner in both patient populations. Dose-dependent increases in 24-h UGE were 
      observed with dapagliflozin in both populations. Unadjusted results showed that 
      with regard to UGE response, dapagliflozin was more potent in patients with T1DM 
      {mean half-maximum effective concentration [EC50 ] = 2.72 ng/ml [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.14, 5.08]} than in patients with T2DM [EC50  = 12.2 ng/ml (95% CI 
      4.91, 21.1)]. After normalization for baseline fasting plasma glucose, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate and UGE, however, the UGE potency of dapagliflozin was 
      similar between the two populations [T1DM: mean EC50 , 8.12 ng/ml (95% CI 2.95, 
      14.6); T2DM: mean EC50 , 7.75 ng/ml (95% CI 1.35, 18.1)]. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics and the predicted UGE dose exposure response to 
      dapagliflozin were similar in patients with T1DM and those with T2DM and suggest 
      that the dapagliflozin dosages currently used for the treatment of T2DM may 
      provide benefit as add-on therapy to insulin in patients with T1DM.

TI  - Improved Manufacturability and In Vivo Comparative Pharmacokinetics of 
      Dapagliflozin Cocrystals in Beagle Dogs and Human Volunteers.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13010070 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - Dapagliflozin (DAP), which improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus, has poor physical properties against heat and moisture, thus 
      hindering its manufacturing potential. The superior physicochemical properties of 
      a recently developed cocrystal of DAP and citric acid (DAP cocrystal) in 
      comparison with those of DAP and Forxiga(®), a patented solvate form with 
      propandiol monohydrate, were identified via structural analysis and moisture 
      sorption isotherm. For the first time, the formulation, manufacturability, and in 
      vivo bioavailability of DAP cocrystals were successfully investigated to develop 
      oral dosage forms that substitute Forxiga(®). The intrinsic dissolution rate of 
      DAP cocrystal was controlled by varying particle size distribution. Unlike the 
      direct compression (DC), roller compaction (RC) was more preferable to obtain 
      good flowability of dry granules for a continuous manufacturing system. The 
      cocrystal structure was maintained throughout the stability assessment period. In 
      Vitro dissolution pattern differences of the optimized DAP cocrystal tablet with 
      RC and the reference tablet, Forxiga(®) 10 mg, were pharmaceutically equivalent 
      within 5% in four different media. Furthermore, comparative pharmacokinetic 
      analysis confirmed that a 10 mg DAP cocrystal tablet with RC was bioequivalent to 
      a 10 mg Forxiga(®) tablet, as assessed in beagle dogs and human volunteers.

AB  - AIM: To determine the absolute oral bioavailability (F(p.o.) ) of saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin using simultaneous intravenous ¹⁴C-microdose/therapeutic oral 
      dosing (i.v.micro + oraltherap). METHODS: The F(p.o.) values of saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin were determined in healthy subjects (n = 7 and 8, respectively) 
      following the concomitant administration of single i.v. micro doses with 
      unlabelled oraltherap doses. Accelerator mass spectrometry and liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to quantify the labelled and 
      unlabelled drug, respectively. RESULTS: The geometric mean point estimates (90% 
      confidence interval) F(p.o) . values for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin were 50% 
      (48, 53%) and 78% (73, 83%), respectively. The i.v.micro had similar 
      pharmacokinetics to oraltherap. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous i.v.micro + oraltherap 
      dosing is a valuable tool to assess human absolute bioavailability.

TI  - Dapagliflozin, a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, induces dose-dependent glucosuria in 
      healthy subjects.
PG  - 520-6
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2008.251 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin selectively inhibits renal glucose reabsorption by inhibiting 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2). It was developed as an 
      insulin-independent treatment approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the drug were 
      evaluated in single-ascending-dose (SAD; 2.5-500 mg) and multiple-ascending-dose 
      (MAD; 2.5-100 mg daily for 14 days) studies in healthy subjects. Dapagliflozin 
      exhibited dose-proportional plasma concentrations with a half-life of 
      approximately 17 h. The amount of glucosuria was also dose-dependent. Cumulative 
      amounts of glucose excreted on day 1, relating to doses from 2.5-100 mg (MAD), 
      ranged from 18 to 62 g; day 14 values were comparable to day 1 values, with no 
      apparent changes in glycemic parameters. Doses of approximately 20-50 mg provided 
      close-to-maximal SGLT2 inhibition for at least 24 h. Dapagliflozin demonstrates 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and dose-dependent glucosuria that are 
      sustained over 24 h, which indicates that it is suitable for administration in 
      once-daily doses and suggests that further investigation of its efficacy in T2DM 
      patients is warranted.

AB  - Physical storage of formulations may result in physical composition changes that 
      affect pharmacokinetics. Dapagliflozin, an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitor used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, stored under prolonged exposure to 
      heat converts crystalline dapagliflozin to an amorphous form. Bioequivalence of 
      the amorphous to crystalline form and food effects of each form in the 2.5-mg 
      formulation are unknown. Two open-label, crossover, single-dose studies in 
      healthy participants assessed pharmacokinetics for heat-stressed (HS) and 
      non-heat-stressed (NH) dapagliflozin 10-mg (study 1, N=29, fasted+HS food effect) 
      and 2.5-mg (study 2, N=28, fasted+HS and NH food effect) tablets. The 90% 
      confidence intervals for geometric mean ratios of area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) for HS 2.5- and 
      10-mg tablets were within 80-125%, indicating bioequivalence. In the fed vs. 
      fasted state for 2.5-mg and 10-mg HS tablets, AUCs were similar, time to Cmax was 
      prolonged by 1.25h, and Cmax decreased by approximately 50%. No serious adverse 
      events were reported. Given that dapagliflozin's efficacy is dependent upon AUC, 
      it was concluded that HS and NH dapagliflozin tablets are bioequivalent in 2.5- 
      and 10-mg doses with no clinically meaningful food effect for either form.

TI  - Effects of dapagliflozin on insulin-requirement, glucose excretion and

PG  - 1635-1639

AB  - Youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) infrequently achieve HbA1c targets. Therefore, 
      this placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study was set up to assess the 
      safety, effect and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin 
      (DAPA) as add-on to insulin in relationship to HbA1c in youth. A total of 33 
      youths (14 males, median age 16 years, diabetes duration 8 years) were included 
      and stratified into 3 baseline HbA1c categories (<7.5%, 7.5%-9.0% or >9.0; n = 11 
      each). During the study period of 24 hours, intravenous insulin administration 
      and glucose-infusion kept blood glucose levels at 160 to 220 mg/dL. DAPA reduced 
      mean insulin dose by 13.6% ( P  < .0001 by ANOVA) and increased urinary glucose 
      excretion by 610% (143.4 vs 22.4 g/24 h; P  < .0001), both irrespective of 
      baseline HbA1c. Six independent episodes in 6 patients with plasma 
      ß-hydroxybutyrate levels between ≥0.6 and <1.0 mmol/L were observed after liquid 
      meal challenges, 5 episodes in the DAPA group and 1 in the placebo group. This 
      study provides a proof-of-concept, irrespective of preexisting HbA1c levels, for 
      adjunct SGLT2-inhibitor therapy in the paediatric age group by lowering insulin 
      dose and increasing glucose excretion.

AB  - In this study a sensitive UHPLC-QTOF-MS method was developed and validated for 
      the quantitation of the metformin (MET) and teneligliptin (TEN) in rat plasma 
      using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation were 
      carried out on a Acquity UPLC HSS Cyano column (100mm x 2.1mm, 1.8μm) using 
      gradient mobile phase system consisting of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile at a 
      flow rate of 0.4mL/min, within a run time of 6min. Protein precipitation method 
      was used as sample preparation approach. Detection of target ions [M+H](+) at m/z 
      130.1085 for MET, m/z 427.2277 for TEN and m/z 409.1623 for IS was performed at 
      positive ion electrospray ionization mode. Linearity was assessed in the range of 
      0.98-1000ng/mL for both MET and TEN. The developed assay was validated as per 
      US-FDA and EMA bioanalytical guidelines and successfully applied to 
      pharmacokinetic interaction study in SD rats. A 1.1 fold increment in the AUC 
      levels of MET and TEN was observed when co-administered together in rats.

      glucose excretion in healthy subjects.
PG  - 423-5
LID - 10.1111/dom.12425 [doi]
AB  - The primary objective of this single-centre, open-label crossover study 
      (NCT01072578) was to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on the amount of glucose 
      in the blood and urine in healthy volunteers when dapagliflozin was administered 
      once a day (10 mg) versus twice a day (5 mg every 12 h) after 5 days of dosing. 
      At steady state, the AUC(ss)₀₋₂₄ (area under the dapagliflozin curve (0-24 hours) 
      at steady state), C(ss,av) (average concentration at steady state) between 
      dapagliflozin 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg once daily were similar AUC(ss)₀₋₂₄ [5 
      mg bid, (458.0 (28.7)) and 10 mg qd, (470.0 (28.5))] and C(ss,av) [5 mg bid 18.8 
      (28.9)) and 10 mg qd, (19.6(28.5))], but minimum and maximum plasma levels of 
      dapagliflozin differed significantly. Percent inhibition of renal glucose 
      reabsorption (%IRGRA) and total urinary glucose excretion over 24 h were similar 
      for both doses. The relationship between the mean dapagliflozin concentration and 
      %IRGRA and the total urinary glucose excreted was well described by a maximum 
      effect model. The results indicate that dapagliflozin may be used for either once 
      daily or twice daily administration.

TI  - Simultaneous quantitation of metformin and dapagliflozin in human plasma by 
      LC-MS/MS: Application to a pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - e4453
LID - 10.1002/bmc.4453 [doi]
AB  - A single LC-MS/MS assay has been developed and validated for the simultaneous 
      determination of metformin and dapagliflozin in human plasma using ion-pair 
      solid-phase extraction. Chromatographic separation of the analytes and their 
      internal standards was carried out on a reversed-phase ACE 5CN (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 
      μm) column using acetonitrile-15 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5 (70:30, v/v) as the 
      mobile phase. To achieve higher sensitivity and selectivity for the analytes, 
      mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a polarity switching approach. 
      Ion transitions studied using multiple reaction monitoring mode were m/z 130.1 
      [M + H](+) /60.1 for metformin and m/z 467.1 [M + CH(3) COO](-) /329.1 for 
      dapagliflozin in the positive and negative modes, respectively. The linear 
      calibration range of the assay was established from 1.00 to 2000 ng/mL for 
      metformin and from 0.10 to 200 ng/mL for dapagliflozin to achieve a better 
      assessment of the pharmacokinetics of the drugs. The limit of detection and limit 
      of quantitation for the analytes were 0.39 and 1.0 ng/mL for metformin and 0.03 
      and 0.1 ng/mL for dapagliflozin, respectively. There was no interference of 
      plasma matrix obtained from different sources, including hemolyzed and lipemic 
      plasma. The method was successfully applied to study the effect of food on the 
      pharmacokinetics of metformin and dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

TI  - Comparative Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of a Novel Sodium-Glucose 
      Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor, DWP16001, with Dapagliflozin and Ipragliflozin.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12030268 [doi]
LID - 268
AB  - Since sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced blood glucose 
      level by inhibiting renal tubular glucose reabsorption mediated by SGLT2, we 
      aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and kidney distribution of DWP16001, a 
      novel SGLT2 inhibitor, and to compare these properties with those of 
      dapagliflozin and ipragliflozin, representative SGLT2 inhibitors. The plasma 
      exposure of DWP16001 was comparable with that of ipragliflozin but higher than 
      that of dapagliflozin. DWP16001 showed the highest kidney distribution among 
      three SGLT2 inhibitors when expressed as an area under curve (AUC) ratio of 
      kidney to plasma (85.0 ± 16.1 for DWP16001, 64.6 ± 31.8 for dapagliflozin and 
      38.4 ± 5.3 for ipragliflozin). The organic anion transporter-mediated kidney 
      uptake of DWP16001 could be partly attributed to the highest kidney uptake. 
      Additionally, DWP16001 had the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration 
      (IC(50)) to SGLT2, a target transporter (0.8 ± 0.3 nM for DWP16001, 1.6 ± 0.3 nM 
      for dapagliflozin, and 8.9 ± 1.7 nM for ipragliflozin). The inhibition mode of 
      DWP16001 on SGLT2 was reversible and competitive, but the recovery of the SGLT2 
      inhibition after the removal of SGLT2 inhibitors in CHO cells overexpressing 
      SGLT2 was retained with DWP16001, which is not the case with dapagliflozin and 
      ipragliflozin. In conclusion, selective and competitive SGLT2 inhibition of 
      DWP16001 could potentiate the efficacy of DWP16001 in coordination with the 
      higher kidney distribution and retained SGLT2 inhibition of DWP16001 relative to 
      dapagliflozin and ipragliflozin.

AB  - PURPOSE: Coadministration of lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin is expected to 
      result in a blood glucose-lowering effect, followed by a gradual increase, in 
      clinical usage; however, combining drugs could cause negative interactions. This 
      study aimed to evaluate the effect of the coadministration of lobeglitazone and 
      dapagliflozin on their individual pharmacokinetic properties at steady state in 
      healthy male volunteers in the fasted state. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 
      parts, each of which was a randomized, open-labeled, multiple-dose, 2-way 
      crossover study in 20 healthy male volunteers in each part. Blood samples were 
      taken periodically over a 48-h period after dosing to derive total plasma 
      lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin pharmacokinetic properties; safety profile was 
      evaluated throughout the study. FINDINGS: When the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      dapagliflozin were evaluated following its administration alone and in 
      combination with lobeglitazone, point estimate and 90% CI of the geometric mean 
      ratio of dapagliflozin AUC(τ) were entirely within the conventional 
      bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. However, although it was not clinically 
      meaningful, its C(ss,max) was ~8% lower in subjects receiving multiple doses of 
      dapagliflozin and lobeglitazone than that in those administered dapagliflozin 
      alone. The pharmacokinetic properties of lobeglitazone were evaluated following 
      its administration alone and in combination with dapagliflozin. The geometric 
      mean ratios and 90% CIs of the lobeglitazone C(ss,max) and AUC(τ) were within the 
      conventional bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. IMPLICATIONS: Coadministration of 
      lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin had no apparent clinically relevant effects on 
      the pharmacokinetic properties of either drug. Based on these findings, it is 
      anticipated that lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin can be coadministered without 
      dose adjustment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03616392.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in combination with 
      insulin in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 876-882

AB  - AIMS: To assess the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of dapagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor that increases urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE) and its major metabolite, dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), 
      in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and inadequate glycaemic control 
      (HbA1c 7%-10%). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese patients (18-65 years) with 
      inadequately controlled T1D were randomized 1:1:1 to dapagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg or 
      placebo (n = 14 each) once daily for 7 days, with adjustable insulin. The PK/PD 
      characteristics of dapagliflozin and D3OG were assessed on Day 7. Patients 
      underwent follow-up evaluation on Days 8 and 14. Adverse events (AEs), 
      hypoglycaemic episodes and events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were recorded 
      over the treatment and follow-up periods. RESULTS: A total of 42 randomized 
      patients received dapagliflozin or placebo. PK variables increased in a 
      dose-dependent manner. D3OG was generated rapidly, with a median time to maximum 
      plasma concentration of 2.0 hours (1.0-3.0). The dapagliflozin dose-UGE 
      relationship was attenuated, with larger insulin dose reductions than 
      anticipated. Mean percent (standard error) changes in total daily insulin dose 
      from baseline to Day 7 were - 36.86% (3.32), -39.13% (2.68) and - 4.97% (5.28) 
      for dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg and for placebo, respectively. No DKA was 
      reported. AEs were consistent with the established dapagliflozin safety profile. 
      There was no increase in hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The PK and safety profiles 
      of dapagliflozin in Japanese patients with T1D were consistent with previous 
      studies, but with an unanticipated attenuation of the PD dose-response measured 
      as UGE.

TI  - Effects of rifampin and mefenamic acid on the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin.
PG  - 280-3
LID - 10.1111/dom.12024 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitor that decreases serum glucose by reducing renal glucose reabsorption, 
      thereby promoting urinary glucose excretion. Dapagliflozin is primarily 
      metabolized via the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 pathway 
      to its major inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the potential for drug-drug interaction between 
      dapagliflozin and two potential UGT1A9 modulators. METHODS: The results of two 
      open-label, non-randomized, single-sequence studies are reported in which the 
      effects of rifampin (a pleiotropic drug-metabolizing enzyme inducer; study 1) and 
      mefenamic acid (a strong UGT1A9 inhibitor; study 2) were evaluated on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (assessed by urinary glucose excretion 
      [UGE]) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. In study 1, 14 subjects received 
      single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg alone and in the presence of rifampin 600 mg 
      QD (6 days). In study 2, 16 subjects received single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg 
      alone and in the presence of mefenamic acid 250 mg q6h (5 days). RESULTS: 
      Rifampin reduced total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from 
      time 0 to infinity [AUC0-inf]) to dapagliflozin by 22% and mefenamic acid 
      increased dapagliflozin AUC0-inf by 51%. No clinically meaningful effect of 
      rifampin or mefenamic acid on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin or on 
      dapagliflozin-mediated urinary glucose excretion was observed. CONCLUSION: Modest 
      changes in dapagliflozin exposure were seen with rifampin and mefenamic acid with 
      minor changes in UGE, none of which were considered clinically meaningful.

TI  - Pharmacological evaluation of HM41322, a novel SGLT1/2 dual inhibitor, in vitro 
      and in vivo.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.4196/kjpp.2019.23.1.55 [doi]
AB  - HM41322 is a novel oral sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1/2 dual inhibitor. 
      In this study, the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic 
      profiles of HM41322 were compared to those of dapagliflozin. HM41322 showed a 
      10-fold selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. HM41322 showed an inhibitory effect on 
      SGLT2 similar to dapagliflozin, but showed a more potent inhibitory effect on 
      SGLT1 than dapagliflozin. The maximum plasma HM41322 level after single oral 
      doses at 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg were 142, 439, and 1830 ng/ml, respectively, and the 
      T(1/2) was 3.1 h. HM41322 was rapidly absorbed and reached the circulation within 
      15 min. HM41322 maximized urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting both SGLT1 and 
      SGLT2 in the kidney. HM41322 3 mg/kg caused the maximum urinary glucose excretion 
      in normoglycemic mice (19.32±1.16 mg/g) at 24 h. In normal and diabetic mice, 
      HM41322 significantly reduced glucose excursion. Four-week administration of 
      HM41322 in db/db mice reduced HbA1c in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, 
      HM41322 showed a favorable preclinical profile of postprandial glucose control 
      through dual inhibitory activities against SGLT1 and SGLT2.

AB  - PURPOSE: Simplification of therapeutic regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus can provide convenience that leads to improved compliance. 
      Dapagliflozin/metformin extended-release (XR) fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      tablets offer the convenience of once-daily dosing. Two pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      studies were conducted to establish bioequivalence for 2 doses of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR FDC versus the same dosage of the individual component 
      (IC) tablets in healthy adults. METHODS: Two open-label, randomized, 4-period, 
      4-arm crossover studies were conducted to assess the bioequivalence and PK 
      properties of dapagliflozin and metformin FDCs in healthy subjects under fed and 
      fasting conditions. Participants received single oral doses or once-daily dosing 
      of dapagliflozin/metformin XR (5 mg/500 mg [study 1] or 10 mg/1000 mg [study 2]) 
      for 4 days in an FDC formulation or corresponding strengths of IC tablets. 
      FINDINGS: For both of the studies, dapagliflozin and metformin 5 mg/500 mg or 10 
      mg/1000 mg FDC tablets were bioequivalent to the respective IC tablets. The 90% 
      CIs of the ratio of the adjusted geometric means for all key PK parameters (Cmax, 
      AUC0-T, and AUC0-∞) were contained within the predefined 0.80 to 1.25 range to 
      conclude bioequivalence for both dapagliflozin and metformin. Once-daily dosing 
      to steady state of each FDC tablet had no effect on the PK properties of 
      dapagliflozin or metformin. When the FDCs were administered with a light-fat 
      meal, there was no effect on metformin PK values and only a modest, nonclinically 
      meaningful effect on dapagliflozin PK values. There were no safety or 
      tolerability concerns. IMPLICATIONS: Bioequivalence of the FDCs of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR and the ICs was established, and no safety issues of 
      clinical concern were raised.

TI  - The influence of kidney function on dapagliflozin exposure, metabolism and 
      pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 432-44
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12056 [doi]
AB  - AIM(S): This study assessed the effect of differences in renal function on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a renal sodium glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). METHODS: A single 50 mg dose of dapagliflozin was used to assess 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in five groups: healthy non-diabetic 
      subjects; patients with T2DM and normal kidney function and patients with T2DM 
      and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on estimated creatinine 
      clearance. Subsequently, 20 mg once daily multiple doses of dapagliflozin were 
      evaluated in the patients with T2DM. Formation rates of dapagliflozin 
      3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), an inactive metabolite, were evaluated using human 
      isolated kidney and liver microsomes. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of 
      dapagliflozin and D3OG were incrementally increased with declining kidney 
      function. Steady-state Cmax for dapagliflozin were 4%, 6% and 9% higher and for 
      D3OG were 20%, 37% and 52% higher in patients with mild, moderate and severe 
      renal impairment, respectively, compared with normal function. AUC(0,τ) was 
      likewise higher. D3OG formation in kidney microsomes was three-fold higher than 
      in liver microsomes and 109-fold higher than in intestine microsomes. Compared 
      with patients with normal renal function, pharmacodynamic effects were attenuated 
      with renal impairment. Steady-state renal glucose clearance was reduced by 42%, 
      83% and 84% in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that both kidney and liver 
      significantly contribute to dapagliflozin metabolism, resulting in higher 
      systemic exposure with declining kidney function. Dapagliflozin pharmacodynamics 
      in diabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment are consistent with 
      the observation of reduced efficacy in this patient population.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Added to Verinurad Plus Febuxostat Further Reduces Serum Uric Acid 
      in Hyperuricemia: The QUARTZ Study.
PG  - e2347-e2356
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa748 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Combining a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor with a xanthine 
      oxidase inhibitor (XOI) and a urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor may enhance 
      serum uric acid (sUA) lowering. However, concerns exist regarding high urinary UA 
      (uUA) excretion rates and subsequent crystallization in renal tubules. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess whether dapagliflozin added to verinurad, a selective URAT1 inhibitor, 
      and febuxostat, an XOI, increases uUA excretion. DESIGN: Randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study (NCT03316131). PATIENTS: Adults with 
      asymptomatic hyperuricemia. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects (N = 36) were randomized to 
      oral once-daily 9 mg verinurad plus 80 mg febuxostat plus 10 mg dapagliflozin for 
      7 days and 7 days of oral once-daily 9 mg verinurad plus 80 mg febuxostat plus 
      placebo with an intervening 7- to 21-day washout period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Difference in peak uUA excretion between groups from baseline to day 7. Secondary 
      outcomes included changes in sUA levels and 24-h uUA excretion. RESULTS: Both 
      regimens lowered mean peak uUA excretion (least squares mean changes from 
      baseline: -12.9 mg/h [95% confidence interval (CI): -21.0 to -4.7], 
      dapagliflozin; -13.2 mg/h [95% CI -21.3 to -5.0], placebo). sUA concentrations 
      were lower with dapagliflozin (mean treatment difference -62.3 µmol/L [95% CI 
      -82.8 to -41.8]). Dapagliflozin did not impact verinurad pharmacokinetics, its 
      main metabolites, or febuxostat or fasting plasma glucose levels vs verinurad 
      plus febuxostat. There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin further reduced sUA without influencing uUA excretion, 
      suggesting that its combination with verinurad and febuxostat at the doses tested 
      does not adversely affect kidney function. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      NCT03316131.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interactions between dapagliflozin and simvastatin,

PG  - 163-77
LID - 10.1007/s12325-011-0098-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease are 
      the most common causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). The aim of these studies was to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor 
      being developed for the treatment of T2DM, and four medications commonly 
      prescribed in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease: simvastatin, 
      valsartan, warfarin, and digoxin. METHODS: Potential pharmacokinetic interactions 
      between 20 mg dapagliflozin, 40 mg simvastatin, or 320 mg valsartan were assessed 
      in an open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover 
      study in 24 healthy subjects. In a second study, the effects of steady-state 
      dapagliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of 25 mg warfarin or 0.25 mg digoxin were 
      assessed in an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment crossover study 
      in 30 healthy subjects divided into two cohorts. The potential pharmacodynamic 
      interaction between dapagliflozin and warfarin was also evaluated. RESULTS: All 
      treatments were well tolerated. Neither simvastatin nor valsartan had any 
      clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin. 
      Dapagliflozin increased the area under the curve for simvastatin, simvastatin 
      acid, and valsartan by approximately 19%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, and 
      decreased the maximum observed plasma concentration of valsartan by approximately 
      6%. These effects were not considered clinically meaningful. In addition, 
      dapagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either digoxin or 
      warfarin. The pharmacodynamics of warfarin were also unaffected by dapagliflozin. 
      CONCLUSION: In these studies the co-administration of dapagliflozin and 
      simvastatin, valsartan, warfarin, or digoxin was well tolerated without 
      clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction.

TI  - A new HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      and metformin in plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - e4663
LID - 10.1002/bmc.4663 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring the plasma concentrations of metformin and sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) is 
      essential for pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies and therapeutic 
      monitoring. The present work therefore aimed to develop and validate a 
      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of these drugs in human 
      plasma. The analyses were performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system coupled to 
      an Applied Biosystems API 3200 triple quadrupole MS/MS with electrospray 
      ionization in positive ion mode. After one-step protein precipitation of plasma 
      with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, chromatographic separation was 
      achieved on an Xbridge C(18) column, with a mobile phase consisting of a gradient 
      of water and acetonitrile, both containing 1 mm ammonium formate and 0.1% formic 
      acid. Quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode using m/z 
      130.1 → 71.1 for metformin, m/z 462.0 → 191.2 for canagliflozin, m/z 
      426.1 → 167.1 for dapagliflozin and m/z 468.0 → 354.9 for empagliflozin. The 
      proposed method was validated and demonstrated to be adequate for the 
      quantification of metformin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin for 
      clinical monitoring, pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies.

AB  - AIM: Janagliflozin is an orally selective SGLT2 inhibitor. To predict human 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) characteristics of janagliflozin. To 
      design optimal starting dose and effective dose for janagliflozin first-in-human 
      (FIH) study. METHODS: Animal PK/PD properties of janagliflozin were obtained from 
      preclinical in vivo and in vitro study. Pharmacologically effective level of same 
      class SGLT2 inhibitors were assessed through preclinical and clinical efficacy 
      data of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. Human PK parameters and 
      profiles of janagliflozin were predicted by various methods such as allometric 
      scaling (AS), dedrick and PK/PD modeling analysis. Mechanistic PK/PD model was 
      developed to describe janagliflozin-mediated impact on urinary glucose excretion 
      (UGE). Human IC(50) was scaled from rat model-estimated IC(50) by correcting 
      interspecies difference of in vitro IC(50) and plasma f(u) of rat and human. The 
      quantitative PK/PD prediction of janagliflozin was evaluated via observed PK/PD 
      profiles of healthy subjects. Predicted PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin 
      were applied in FIH dose design. Optimal starting dose was suggested by 
      considering preclinical PD and toxicity data of janagliflozin. Effective dose was 
      suggested by considering pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs. 
      RESULTS: PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin in preclinical species were 
      summarized. Pharmacologically effective level for SGLT2 inhibitors was defined as 
      25~30% ΔUGE (ΔUGE=--(PG*GFR)(within24h)) based on efficacy data of three same 
      class drugs. Human predicted CL, V(ss) and F were 1.04 L/h, 77.5 L and 0.80. 
      Predicted AUC and C(max) of janagliflozin of 10 and 50 mg were within 0.47~2.08 
      fold of observed values. Predicted human UGE(0-)24 h and UGE(0-)144 h of 10 and 
      50 mg dose range were within 0.66~1.41 fold of observed values. Optimal starting 
      dose and pharmacologically active dose (PAD) were suggested as 10 mg and 50 mg. 
      Dose range for FIH study was designed as 10-450 mg. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      predicted human PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin based on preclinical data 
      and provide optimal dose design for janagliflozin FIH study based on 
      pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs.

TI  - Exploring the potential of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in type 1 diabetes: 
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
PG  - 412-9
LID - 10.2337/dc13-2955 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin adjustments to maintain glycemic control in individuals with 
      type 1 diabetes often lead to wide glucose fluctuations, hypoglycemia, and 
      increased body weight. Dapagliflozin, an insulin-independent sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increases glucosuria and reduces hyperglycemia 
      in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of this study was to 
      assess short-term safety of dapagliflozin in combination with insulin; secondary 
      objectives included pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy parameters. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-week, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study randomly assigned 70 adults with type 1 
      diabetes (HbA1c 7-10%), who were receiving treatment with stable doses of 
      insulin, to one of four dapagliflozin doses (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo. The 
      insulin dose was not proactively reduced at randomization but could be adjusted 
      for safety reasons. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (88.6%) completed the study. Any 
      hypoglycemia was common across all treatments (60.0-92.3%); one major event of 
      hypoglycemia occurred with dapagliflozin 10 mg. No diabetic ketoacidosis 
      occurred. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. Glucosuria increased by 88 g/24 h (95% CI 55 to 121) with 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg and decreased by -21.5 g/24 h (95% CI -53.9 to 11.0) with 
      placebo. Changes from baseline with dapagliflozin 10 mg by day 7 were as follows: 
      -2.29 mmol/L (95% CI -3.71 to -0.87 [-41.3 mg/dL; 95% CI -66.9 to -15.7]) for 
      24-h daily average blood glucose; -3.77 mmol/L (95% CI -6.09 to -1.45 [-63.1 
      mg/dL; 95% CI -111.5 to -14.8]) for mean amplitude of glycemic excursion; and 
      -16.2% (95% CI -29.4 to -0.5) for mean percent change in total daily insulin 
      dose. Corresponding changes with placebo were as follows: -1.13 mmol/L (95% CI 
      -3.63 to 1.37), -0.45 mmol/L (95% CI -4.98 to 4.08), and 1.7% (95% CI -22.8 to 
      33.9), respectively. However, for every efficacy parameter, the 95% CIs for all 
      dapagliflozin doses overlapped those for placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory 
      study of dapagliflozin in adults with type 1 diabetes demonstrated acceptable 
      short-term tolerability and expected pharmacokinetic profiles and increases in 
      urinary glucose excretion. Within the dapagliflozin groups, dose-related 
      reductions in 24-h glucose, glycemic variability, and insulin dose were 
      suggested, which provide hope that SGLT2 inhibition may prove in larger 
      randomized controlled trials to be efficacious in reducing hyperglycemia in type 
      1 diabetes.

AB  - Saxagliptin and dapagliflozin are individually indicated as an adjunct to diet 
      and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      The bioequivalence of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin 2.5/5 mg and 5/10 mg fixed-dose 
      combination (FDC) tablets compared with coadministration of the individual 
      tablets and the food effect on both strengths of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin FDCs 
      were evaluated in this open-label, randomized, single-dose crossover study. 
      Healthy subjects were randomized to saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 5 mg 
      fasted, 2.5/5 mg FDC fasted, 2.5/5 mg FDC fed (Cohort 1) or saxagliptin 
      5 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg fasted, 5/10 mg FDC fasted, 5/10 mg FDC fed (Cohort 
      2). Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin 
      were obtained predose and up to 60 h postdose. Bioequivalence of FDC tablets 
      versus individual components was concluded if the 90% CIs for FDC to individual 
      component geometric mean ratios of C max, AUC 0-T, and AUC inf of both analytes 
      were between 0.80 and 1.25. Seventy-two subjects were randomized; 71 (98.6%) 
      completed the study. Saxagliptin/dapagliflozin 2.5/5 mg and 5/10 mg FDC tablets 
      were bioequivalent to the individual tablets administered concomitantly. Food had 
      no clinically meaningful effect on saxagliptin or dapagliflozin overall systemic 
      exposure. Saxagliptin/dapagliflozin FDC tablets were bioequivalent to 
      coadministration of the individual components in healthy subjects under fasted 
      conditions and food had no clinically meaningful effect on bioavailability.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a selective 
      inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2.
PG  - 17-27
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0104-3 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is predominantly expressed in the S1 
      segment of the proximal tubule of the kidney and is the major transporter 
      responsible for mediating renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin is an orally 
      active, highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by reducing renal glucose 
      reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). Orally 
      administered dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed generally achieving peak plasma 
      concentrations within 2 h. Dose-proportional systemic exposure to dapagliflozin 
      has been observed over a wide dose range (0.1-500 mg) with an oral 
      bioavailability of 78 %. Dapagliflozin has extensive extravascular distribution 
      (mean volume of distribution of 118 L). Dapagliflozin metabolism occurs 
      predominantly in the liver and kidneys by uridine 
      diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A9 to the major metabolite dapagliflozin 
      3-O-glucuronide (this metabolite is not an SGLT2 inhibitor at clinically relevant 
      exposures). Dapagliflozin is not appreciably cleared by renal excretion (<2 % of 
      dose is recovered in urine as parent). Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide elimination 
      occurs mainly via renal excretion, with 61 % of a dapagliflozin dose being 
      recovered as this metabolite in urine. The half-life for orally administered 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg was 12.9 h. Maximal increases in urinary glucose excretion 
      were seen at doses ≥20 mg/day in patients with T2DM. No clinically relevant 
      differences were observed in dapagliflozin exposure with respect to age, race, 
      sex, body weight, food, or presence of T2DM. Pharmacodynamic changes are 
      dependent on plasma glucose and renal function, and decreases in urinary glucose 
      excretion were observed due to the lower filtered load (plasma glucose × 
      glomerular filtration rate) in healthy volunteers compared to subjects with T2DM. 
      After multiple doses of dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion was associated 
      with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose parameters in subjects with T2DM. 
      Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment show higher systemic exposure to 
      dapagliflozin. No clinically relevant drug interactions were observed that would 
      necessitate dose adjustment of dapagliflozin when administered with other 
      antidiabetic or cardiovascular medications, as well as drugs that could 
      potentially influence dapagliflozin metabolism.

AB  - A series of highly active C-aryl glucoside SGLT2 inhibitors containing a biphenyl 
      motif were designed and synthesized for biological evaluation. Among the 
      compounds tested, compound 16l demonstrated high inhibitory activity against 
      SGLT2 (IC50=1.9 nM) with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile. Further study 
      indicated that the in vivo efficacy of compound 16l was comparable to that of 
      dapagliflozin, suggesting that further development would be worthwhile.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors in 
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 
      cotransporters are responsible for reabsorption of 90 % of the glucose filtered 
      by the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition contributes 
      to reduce hyperglycaemia and also assists weight loss and blood pressure 
      reduction. Several SGLT2 inhibitors are already available in many countries 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) and in Japan (ipragliflozin, 
      tofogliflozin). These SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life 
      allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via 
      glucuronidation to inactive metabolites and a low renal elimination as a parent 
      drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters are slightly altered in the case of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). While no dose adjustment is required in the case of mild 
      CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors may not be used or only at a lower daily dose in patients 
      with moderate CKD. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors 
      as assessed by urinary glucose excretion declines with increasing severity of 
      renal impairment as assessed by a reduction in the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate. Nevertheless, the glucose-lowering efficacy and safety of SGLT2 
      inhibitors are almost comparable in patients with mild CKD as in patients with 
      normal kidney function. In patients with moderate CKD, the efficacy tends to be 
      dampened and safety concerns may occur. In patients with severe CKD, the use of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Thus, prescribing information should be 
      consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in the case of renal 
      dysfunction for each SGLT2 inhibitor. The clinical impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on 
      renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic 
      nephropathy deserve attention because of preliminary favourable results in animal 
      models.

AB  - Treatment of hyperglycemia with drugs that block renal glucose reabsorption via 
      inhibition of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is a novel 
      approach to diabetes management. In this study, twenty-seven aryl C-glycosides 
      bearing a C=N/C-N linkage at the glucosyl C6 position were designed, synthesized 
      and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against human SGLT2 (hSGLT2). 
      Compounds with good hSGLT2 inhibition were further investigated to determine 
      their selectivity over hSGLT1. Of these, five representative aryl C-glycosides 
      were chosen for pharmacokinetic analysis. Oxime 2a was determined to have the 
      most promising pharmacokinetic properties and was selected for in vivo glucosuria 
      and plasma glucose level studies, which found it to exhibit comparable efficacy 
      to dapagliflozin (1). Furthermore, 2a was not found to exhibit either significant 
      cytotoxicity (CC(50) > 50 μM) or human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) 
      inhibition (2% inhibition at 10 μM). Taken together, these efforts culminated in 
      the discovery of oxime 2a as a potential SGLT2 inhibitor.

AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 offer a novel approach to treating type 
      2 diabetes by reducing hyperglycaemia via increased urinary glucose excretion. In 
      the present study, the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacologic 
      properties of all six SGLT2 inhibitors commercially available in Japan were 
      investigated and compared. Based on findings in normal and diabetic mice, the six 
      drugs were classified into two categories, long-acting: ipragliflozin and 
      dapagliflozin, and intermediate-acting: tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, 
      empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin. Long-acting SGLT2 inhibitors exerted an 
      antihyperglycemic effect with lower variability of blood glucose level via a 
      long-lasting increase in urinary glucose excretion. In addition, ipragliflozin 
      and luseogliflozin exhibited superiority over the others with respect to fast 
      onset of pharmacological effect. Duration and onset of the pharmacologic effects 
      seemed to be closely correlated with the pharmacokinetic properties of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor, particularly with respect to high distribution and long retention in 
      the target organ, the kidney. While all six SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly 
      effective in increasing urinary glucose excretion and reducing hyperglycemia, our 
      findings suggest that variation in the quality of daily blood glucose control 
      associated with duration and onset of pharmacologic effects of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor might cause slight differences in rates of improvement in type 2 
      diabetes.

TI  - Development and optimization of sitagliptin and dapagliflozin loaded oral 
      self-nanoemulsifying formulation against type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Control of hyperglycemia and prevention of glucose reabsorption (glucotoxicity) 
      are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. This study deals 
      with an oral combined dosage form design for two anti-diabetic drugs, sitagliptin 
      and dapagliflozin using self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). The 
      SNEDDS were developed using naturally obtained bioactive medium-chain/long-chain 
      triglycerides oil, mixed glycerides and nonionic surfactants, and droplet size 
      was measured followed by the test for antioxidant activities. Equilibrium 
      solubility and dynamic dispersion experiments were conducted to achieve the 
      maximum drug loading. The in vitro digestion, in vivo bioavailability, and 
      anti-diabetic effects were studied to compare the representative SNEDDS with 
      marketed product Dapazin(®). The representative SNEDDS containing black seed oil 
      showed excellent self-emulsification performance with transparent appearance. 
      Characterization of the SNEDDS showed nanodroplets of around 50-66.57 nm in size 
      (confirmed by TEM analysis), in addition to the high drug loading capacity 
      without causing any precipitation in the gastro-intestinal tract. The SNEDDS 
      provided higher antioxidant activity compared to the pure drugs. The in vivo 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of SNEDDS showed significant increase in C (max) 
      (1.99 ± 0.21 µg mL(-1)), AUC (17.94 ± 1.25 µg mL(-1)), and oral absorption 
      (2-fold) of dapagliflozin compared to the commercial product in the rat model. 
      The anti-diabetic studies showed the significant inhibition of glucose level in 
      treated diabetic mice by SNEDDS combined dose compared to the single drug 
      therapy. The combined dose of sitagliptin-dapagliflozin using SNEDDS could be a 
      potential oral pharmaceutical product for the improved treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus.

TI  - A simple and rapid LC-MS/MS method for quantitation of luseogliflozin in rat 
      plasma and its application to a PK study.
PG  - 163-171
AB  - AIM: Luseogliflozin is a novel sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor 
      for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. To assist pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicodynamic studies, a rapid LC-MS/MS method were developed and validated for 
      the quantitation of luseogliflozin in rat plasma. RESULTS: Sample preparation was 
      carried out using simplified protein precipitation and liquid-liquid extraction 
      procedures, and the run time was only 4 min. Extraction recovery was 92.9 to 
      95.3%, and the method was validated over the range 0.5 to 500 ng/ml for 
      luseogliflozin with acceptable specificity, accuracy and precision. CONCLUSION: 
      The validated method is considered suitable to quantify luseogliflozin in 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic/toxicodynamic studies in rats.

TI  - Model-Informed Pediatric Dose Selection for Dapagliflozin by Incorporating 
      Developmental Changes.
PG  - 108-118
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12577 [doi]
AB  - This analysis reports a quantitative modeling and simulation approach for oral 
      dapagliflozin, a primarily uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 
      (UGT)-metabolized human sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 selective inhibitor. A 
      mechanistic dapagliflozin physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was 
      developed using in vitro metabolism and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data and 
      verified for context of use (e.g., exposure predictions in pediatric subjects 
      aged 1 month to 18 years). Dapagliflozin exposure is challenging to predict in 
      pediatric populations owing to differences in UGT1A9 ontogeny maturation and 
      paucity of clinical PK data in younger age groups. Based on the exposure-response 
      relationship of dapagliflozin, twofold acceptance criteria were applied between 
      model-predicted and observed drug exposures and PK parameters (area under the 
      curve and maximum drug concentration) in various scenarios, including monotherapy 
      in healthy adults (single/multiple dose), monotherapy in hepatically or renally 
      impaired patients, and drug-drug interactions with UGT1A9 modulators, such as 
      mefenamic acid and rifampin. The PBPK model captured the observed exposure within 
      twofold of the observed monotherapy data in adults and adolescents and in special 
      population. As a guide to determining dosing regimens in pediatric studies, the 
      verified PBPK model, along with UGT enzyme ontogeny maturation understanding, was 
      used for predictions of dapagliflozin monotherapy exposures in pediatric subjects 
      aged 1 month to 18 years that best matched exposure in adult patients with a 
      10-mg single dose of dapagliflozin.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of the Drug-Drug Interaction of 
      the UGT Substrate Ertugliflozin Following Co-Administration with the UGT 
      Inhibitor Mefenamic Acid.
PG  - 127-136
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12581 [doi]
AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ertugliflozin is metabolized by the 
      uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes UGT1A9 and 
      UGT2B4/2B7. This analysis evaluated the drug-drug interaction (DDI) following 
      co-administration of ertugliflozin with the UGT inhibitor mefenamic acid (MFA) 
      using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. The ertugliflozin 
      modeling assumptions and parameters were verified using clinical data from 
      single-dose and multiple-dose studies of ertugliflozin in healthy volunteers, and 
      the PBPK fraction metabolized assignments were consistent with human absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion results. The model for MFA was developed 
      using clinical data, and in vivo UGT inhibitory constant values were estimated 
      using the results from a clinical DDI study with MFA and dapagliflozin, a UGT1A9 
      and UGT2B4/2B7 substrate in the same chemical class as ertugliflozin. Using the 
      verified compound files, PBPK modeling predicted an ertugliflozin ratio of area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(R) ) of 1.51 when co-administered 
      with MFA. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00989079.

AB  - AIMS: To quantitate the consistency of an individual's plasma exposure to 
      dapagliflozin upon re-exposure, and to investigate whether the individual's 
      systemic exposure to dapagliflozin explains inter-individual variation in 
      response to dapagliflozin with regard to multiple renal risk markers. METHODS: 
      Data were used from a crossover randomized clinical trial that assessed the 
      albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin in 33 people with type 2 diabetes 
      and elevated albuminuria. Fifteen participants were exposed twice to 
      dapagliflozin. Trough plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin were measured for 
      each participant at steady state. Dapagliflozin plasma concentrations were 
      measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics were simulated based on a population pharmacokinetic model. 
      Linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify the exposure-response 
      relationships. RESULTS: The median plasma concentration after first and second 
      exposure to dapagliflozin was 5.3 ng/mL vs 4.6 ng/mL, respectively (P = 0.78). 
      Lin's concordance correlation coefficient between occasions was 0.73 
      (P < 0.0021). Every 100 ng.h/mL increment in area under the dapagliflozin plasma 
      concentration curve was associated with a decrease in log-transformed urinary 
      albumin:creatinine ratio (β = -5.9, P < 0.01), body weight (β = -0.3, P < 0.01) 
      and estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = -0.7, P = 0.01) and an increase in 
      urinary glucose excretion (β = 17.0, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: An individual's 
      exposure to dapagliflozin is consistent upon re-exposure and correlates with 
      pharmacodynamic response in renal risk markers.

TI  - Use of low-dose clinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data to establish an

      sodium glucose co-transporter 2.

AB  - Classical risk assessment models for setting safe occupational exposure limits 
      (OEL) have used multiple uncertainty factors (UF) applied to a point of departure 
      (POD), e.g., a No Observed Effect Level (NOEL), which in some cases is the 
      pharmacological effect. Dapagliflozin promotes glucosuria by inhibiting the renal 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 transporter. The initial OEL for dapagliflozin 
      (0.002mg/m(3)) was calculated when low dose clinical data was not available to 
      identify a NOEL resulting in the need to use excessive UFs. To reduce the UFs 
      from the OEL, a clinical pharmacodynamic [glucosuria and urinary glucose dipstick 
      (UGD)] and pharmacokinetic study was conducted with single oral doses of 0.001, 
      0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 2.5mg administered to 36 healthy subjects. Dose-related 
      dapagliflozin systemic exposures were observed at doses ⩾0.1mg and glucosuria was 
      observed at doses ⩾0.3mg and corroborated by UGD. The NOEL was therefore 0.1mg 
      for glucosuria. For setting the new OEL, no UFs were required. Dividing the POD 
      by 10m(3) (the volume of air an adult inhales in a workday), the resulting OEL 
      was 0.01mg/m(3). In conclusion, low-dose clinical pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic data can allow the OEL to be adjusted to the highest safe level.

TI  - Bioequivalence of Dapagliflozin/Metformin Extended-release Fixed-combination Drug 
      Product and Single-component Dapagliflozin and Metformin Extended-release Tablets 
      in Healthy Russian Subjects.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fixed-combination drug products (FCDPs) combining dapagliflozin and 
      metformin extended release (XR) may provide patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus with an alternative antihyperglycemic treatment, which could improve 
      adherence by reducing tablet burden. This study evaluated the bioequivalence of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR FCDP versus the co-administration of the individual 
      monotherapy tablets currently available for use in the Russian Federation. 
      METHODS: Healthy subjects aged 18 to 45 years were enrolled in this randomized, 
      open-label, 2-period crossover study, conducted in a single Russian center. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-t), C(max), and C(max)/AUC(0-t)) were used to 
      assess bioequivalence of dapagliflozin/metformin XR (10/1000 mg) FCDP to the 
      individual component tablets (dapagliflozin [10 mg] plus metformin XR [2 × 500 
      mg]) under standard fed conditions. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. 
      FINDINGS: Forty healthy subjects were included (47.5% male; mean age, 30 years; 
      and mean body mass index, 24.2 kg/m(2)). Dapagliflozin and metformin XR in the 
      FCDP were bioequivalent to the individual component tablets marketed in the 
      Russian Federation, with the 90% CIs of the geometric least-squares mean ratios 
      for all key pharmacokinetic parameters being contained within the 80% to 125% 
      bioequivalence limits. Both FCDP and the individual component formulations were 
      well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. IMPLICATIONS: Bioequivalence of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR FCDP and the individual components was established 
      without any new safety concerns, presenting a safe alternative for patients 
      currently receiving regimens including each component individually.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 -inhibitors (SGLT2i) are oral glucose-lowering 
      drugs that have also demonstrated cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. 
      SGLT2i play an increasingly important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Here we report a simple and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of three SGLT2i 
      (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in human plasma, serum and urine 
      with a runtime of 1 min. Methanol was used as protein precipitating agent. 
      Chromatographic separation was accomplished using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 
      1.8 μm; 2.1 × 50 mm column with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm VanGuard 
      Pre-column; 2.1 × 5 mm, using gradient elution with ammonium acetate 20 mM (pH 5) 
      and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Mass spectrometric 
      analysis of the acetate adduct ions was carried out using electrospray with 
      negative ionization and SRM mode. The assay was validated according to FDA and 
      EMA guidelines, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision, 
      dilution integrity, stability and recovery. With a sample volume of 200 µl, 
      linear ranges of 10-5000 µg/L, 1-500 µg/L and 2-1000 µg/L for canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively, were achieved. The assay was 
      successfully applied in two pharmacokinetic studies with dapagliflozin and 
      empagliflozin. In conclusion, we developed and validated a simple, fast and 
      robust LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, that allows rapid analysis of large numbers of 
      samples and can be used for both pharmacokinetic studies and biomedical analysis 
      of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.

AB  - Optimization of extraction and chromatographic conditions is essential for the 
      simultaneous analysis of drugs having different physico-chemical properties, 
      especially for in vivo applications. The present work describes concurrent 
      estimation of metformin (MET) and three sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitors namely canagliflozin (CANA), dapagliflozin (DAPA) and empagliflozin 
      (EMPA) in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). Sample clean-up was optimized using ion-pair solid-phase extraction 
      with sodium lauryl sulphate on Strata-X extraction cartridges. Consistent 
      recoveries were obtained by critically optimizing parameters such as washing and 
      elution solvents during extraction. The extraction recovery ranged from 79 to 88% 
      for all the analytes. Chromatographic separation were accomplished on a Cyano 
      (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column within 5.0 min using acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium 
      formate buffer (75:25, v/v) as the mobile phase. The resolution factors between 
      MET-EMPA, MET-DAPA, MET-CANA, DAPA-EMPA and CANA-DAPA were 4.92, 5.85, 7.13, 1.01 
      and 1.44, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range 
      of 2.00-2000, 3.00-3000, 0.20-200 and 1.50-1500 ng/mL for MET, CANA, DAPA and 
      EMPA, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a polarity 
      switching approach to achieve high sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring 
      mode. The method was validated using current regulatory guidelines and applied to 
      study the pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose formulations of MET and SGLT-2 
      inhibitors in healthy subjects.

TI  - Bioequivalence and Food Effect of Dapagliflozin/Saxagliptin/Metformin 
      Extended-release Fixed-combination Drug Products Compared With Coadministration 
      of the Individual Components in Healthy Subjects.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fixed-combination drug products (FCDPs) for patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may show efficacy comparable to their individual 
      components (ICs) while improving adherence to treatment. This study evaluated the 
      bioequivalence and safety of 2 dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin 
      extended-release (XR) FCDPs relative to their ICs: saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, single-dose, 
      single-center crossover study was conducted in 84 healthy subjects aged 18-55 
      years. The primary objective was to evaluate the fed-state bioequivalence of a 
      dapagliflozin 5-mg/saxagliptin 2.5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP and a 
      dapagliflozin 10-mg/saxagliptin 5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP relative to the 
      ICs. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the effect of food on the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of saxagliptin, dapagliflozin, and metformin in 
      both FCDPs and characterization of the PK parameters of the active metabolite of 
      saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, in healthy subjects. PK parameters (AUC(0-∞), 
      AUC(0-t), and C(max)) were used to assess the bioequivalence of the 2 FCDPs with 
      their ICs. The C(max) and AUC(0-t) of the study drugs were compared between 
      female and male subjects to assess sex differences in exposure. Safety and 
      tolerability of both FCDPs and ICs were also assessed with adverse events, vital 
      signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate), 12-lead ECG, 
      physical examinations, and laboratory assessments. FINDINGS: Both 
      dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin XR FCDPs were bioequivalent to their ICs. For 
      the dapagliflozin 5-mg/saxagliptin 2.5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP, the 90% CI 
      for the geometric mean ratio of dapagliflozin C(max) was slightly above the 
      80%-125% bioequivalence limit, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Food 
      delayed the absorption of the study drugs in both FCDPs, which is unlikely to 
      have a clinically relevant impact on efficacy. In both cohorts, exposure was 
      higher in female subjects compared with male subjects, potentially due to the 
      lower body weight of the female subjects. The safety profile and tolerability of 
      the FCDPs were similar to those of their ICs, and no deaths or serious adverse 
      events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: These data support the use of the 
      dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin XR FCDP in patients with T2DM.

TI  - COMBINED TREATMENT WITH SAXAGLIPTIN PLUS DAPAGLIFLOZIN REDUCES INSULIN LEVELS BY 
      INCREASED INSULIN CLEARANCE AND IMPROVES β-CELL FUNCTION.
PG  - 258-265
LID - 10.4158/EP161323.OR [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if reduction in serum insulin with dapagliflozin plus 
      saxagliptin or dapagliflozin add-on to metformin contributed to increased insulin 
      clearance and to assess the effects of these treatments on β-cell function. 
      METHODS: Patients (glycated hemoglobin, 8 to 12%; 64 to 108 mmol/mol) were 
      randomized to 24-week, double-blind treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg/day plus 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 179), saxagliptin 5 mg/day plus placebo (n = 176), 
      or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus placebo (n = 179) added to metformin. C-peptide 
      to insulin ratio was used as an index of insulin clearance during a meal 
      tolerance test, and β-cell function was evaluated by Homeostasis Model Assessment 
      2. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, compared with baseline, saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and 
      saxagliptin + placebo increased mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) C-peptide 
      area under the curve (AUC(0-180 min)) (40.2 [9.2 to 71.3] ng/mL and 95.4 [63.4 to 
      127.4] ng/mL, respectively); no change was noted with dapagliflozin + placebo 
      (14.5 [-17.6 to 46.8] ng/mL). Insulin AUC was reduced from baseline with 
      saxagliptin + dapagliflozin (-1,120.4 [-1,633.9 to -606.9] μU/mL) and 
      dapagliflozin + placebo (-1,018.6 [-1550.5 to -486.8] μU/mL) but increased with 
      saxagliptin + placebo (661.2 [131.1 to 1,191.3] μU/mL). C-peptide to insulin 
      ratio did not change versus baseline with saxagliptin + placebo but increased 
      after saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo, largely due to 
      decreased insulin AUC with dapagliflozin. All treatments improved β-cell function 
      (mean change [95% CI] from baseline, saxagliptin+dapagliflozin: 20.6% [16.5% to 
      24.8%]; dapagliflozin + placebo: 17.0% [12.7% to 21.4%]; saxagliptin + placebo: 
      11.0% [6.6% to 15.5%]). CONCLUSION: Increased C-peptide to insulin ratio with 
      saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo add-on to metformin 
      compared with saxagliptin + placebo add-on to metformin suggests that 
      dapagliflozin increases insulin clearance and may contribute to lower circulating 
      insulin. All treatments improved β-cell function, with the greatest improvements 
      with saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo. ABBREVIATIONS: A1c

TI  - Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in drug-naive Asian patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: a randomized, blinded, prospective phase III study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dapagliflozin is a highly selective, orally active inhibitor of renal 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 that reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary 
      glucose excretion. The goal of this study was to evaluate dapagliflozin as 
      monotherapy in drug-naive Asian patients with type 2 diabetes whose disease was 
      inadequately controlled with diet and exercise. METHODS: In this Phase III, 
      multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind study, drug-naive patients with 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ≥7.0% to ≤10.5% (≥53-≤91 mmol/mol) were 
      randomized (by using an interactive voice response system) to receive placebo (n 
      = 132), dapagliflozin 5 mg (n = 128), or dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 133). The 
      primary end point was mean change from baseline in HbA1c level at week 24 
      (last-observation-carried-forward). Secondary end points included changes in 
      fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, body weight, and other 
      glycemic parameters. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced across 
      groups. Most patients (89%) were Chinese, median disease duration was 0.2 year, 
      and mean HbA1c level was 8.26%. Most patients (87%) completed the study. At week 
      24, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.29% for placebo versus -1.04% and -1.11% for 
      dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both doses). Changes in 
      fasting plasma glucose were 2.5, -25.1, and -31.6 mg/dL (0.14, -1.39, and -1.75 
      mmol/L) for placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg. Changes in 
      2-hour postprandial glucose were 1.1, -46.8, and -54.9 mg/dL (0.06, -2.60, and 
      -3.05 mmol/L). Reductions in body weight were -0.27, -1.64, and -2.25 kg. 
      Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) were 21.3%, 
      42.6%, and 49.8%. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 63.6%, 61.7%, and 60.9% of 
      patients, and serious AEs occurred in 1.5%, 3.9%, and 3.0% of patients. No deaths 
      occurred. Hypoglycemia was uncommon (1.5%, 0.8%, and 0.8%); no hypoglycemic event 
      led to discontinuation. Genital infections occurred in 0.8%, 3.1%, and 4.5% of 
      patients and urinary tract infections in 3.0%, 3.9%, and 5.3% of patients. No AEs 
      of renal infection or pyelonephritis were reported. No changes in renal function 
      or AEs of renal failure occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, 
      dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg demonstrated clinically and statistically significant 
      improvements in HbA1c levels after 24 weeks of treatment. Dose-dependent, 
      statistically significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, postprandial 
      glucose, and weight were also observed for both doses compared with placebo. AEs 
      and serious AEs were balanced across groups, with low rates of hypoglycemia and 
      no increase in renal events. Genital infections and urinary tract infections were 
      more common with dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in these drug-naive 
      Asian patients was well tolerated, significantly improving glycemic control with 
      the additional benefit of weight loss.

TI  - Physiologically based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling to predict 
      concentrations and actions of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 inhibitor 
      canagliflozin in human intestines and renal tubules.
PG  - 491-506
LID - 10.1002/bdd.2040 [doi]
AB  - Canagliflozin is a recently developed sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 
      inhibitor that promotes renal glucose excretion and is considered to inhibit 
      renal SGLT2 from the luminal side of proximal tubules. Canagliflozin reportedly 
      inhibits SGLT1 weakly and suppresses postprandial plasma glucose, suggesting that 
      it also inhibits intestinal SGLT1. However, it is difficult to measure the drug 
      concentrations of these assumed sites of action directly. The 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of canagliflozin remain 
      poorly characterized. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
      model of canagliflozin was developed based on clinical data from healthy 
      volunteers and it was used to simulate luminal concentrations in intestines and 
      renal tubules. In small intestine simulations, the inhibition ratios for SGLT1 
      were predicted to be 40%-60% after the oral administration of clinical doses 
      (100-300 mg/day). In contrast, inhibition ratios of canagliflozin for renal SGLT2 
      and SGLT1 were predicted to be approximately 100% and 0.2%-0.4%, respectively. 
      These analyses suggest that canagliflozin only inhibits SGLT2 in the kidney. 
      Using the simulated proximal tubule luminal concentrations of canagliflozin, the 
      urinary glucose excretion rates in canagliflozin-treated diabetic patients were 
      accurately predicted using the renal glucose reabsorption model as a PD model. 
      Because the simulation of canagliflozin pharmacokinetics was successful, this 
      PBPK methodology was further validated by successfully simulating the 
      pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin, another SGLT2 inhibitor. The present results 
      suggest the utility of this PBPK/PD model for predicting canagliflozin 
      concentrations at target sites and help to elucidate the pharmacological effects 
      of SGLT1/2 inhibition in humans. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Development of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin for 
      the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 669-83
LID - 10.1586/ecp.11.54 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin is a highly selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor 
      developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its inhibition of 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 blocks glucose reabsorption in the proximal 
      tubule of the kidney, increasing renal glucose excretion via the urine, resulting 
      in reduction of glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial 
      plasma glucose in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin are suitable for once-daily dosing. 
      Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control when used as monotherapy and when used in 
      combination with other antidiabetic treatments. Throughout all phases of clinical 
      studies, dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated. Increased events suggestive 
      of urinary tract and genital infections have been reported; most resolved with 
      conventional treatment. Unexpected numerical imbalances between dapagliflozin and 
      comparator were noted for breast and bladder cancers. The potential for increased 
      cancer risk with dapagliflozin needs to be further assessed.

      humans.
PG  - S20-7
LID - 10.1038/ki.2010.512 [doi]
AB  - Glucose is freely filtered in the glomeruli before being almost entirely 
      reabsorbed into circulation from the proximal renal tubules. The sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), present in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, is 
      responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce 
      glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion. In animal models and 
      humans with type 2 diabetes, this effect is associated with reduced fasting and 
      postprandial blood glucose levels, and reduced hemoglobin A1c. Animal studies 
      suggest that reduction of hyperglycemia with SGLT2 inhibitors may also improve 
      insulin sensitivity and preserve β-cell function. Urinary excretion of excess 
      calories with SGLT2 inhibitors is also associated with reduction in body weight. 
      Modest reductions in blood pressure have been noted with SGLT2 inhibitors, 
      consistent with a mild diuretic action. Some C-glucoside SGLT2 inhibitors, such 
      as dapagliflozin, have pharmacokinetic properties that make them amenable to 
      once-daily dosing.

TI  - Evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes: pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicological considerations.
PG  - 647-63
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2014.873788 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2), which 
      increase urinary glucose excretion independently of insulin, are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). AREAS 
      COVERED: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics, toxicological issues and safety concerns of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in humans. This review focuses on three compounds 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) with results obtained in healthy 
      volunteers (including drug-drug interactions), patients with T2DM (single dose 
      and multiple doses) and special populations (those with renal or hepatic 
      impairment). EXPERT OPINION: The three pharmacological agents share an excellent 
      oral bioavailability, long half-life allowing once-daily administration, low 
      accumulation index and renal clearance, the absence of active metabolites and a 
      limited propensity to drug-drug interactions. No clinically relevant changes in 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in T2DM patients or in patients with 
      mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Adverse events are a slightly 
      increased incidence of mycotic genital and rare benign urinary infections. SGLT2 
      inhibitors have the potential to reduce several cardiovascular risk factors, and 
      cardiovascular outcome trials are currently ongoing. The best positioning of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in the armamentarium for treating T2DM is still a matter of 
      debate.

AB  - PURPOSE: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, fixed-dose combinations 
      (FDCs) of antihyperglycemic medications may provide complementary efficacy while 
      reducing tablet burden and improving compliance. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the bioequivalence and tolerability of 2 FDCs of dapagliflozin and 
      metformin extended-release (XR) versus their individual component (IC) tablets. 
      METHODS: An open-label, balanced, randomized, 2-way crossover, 4-arm study was 
      conducted in 129 healthy Brazilian subjects (aged 18-55 years). Two oral doses of 
      the FDCs (5 mg dapagliflozin and 500 mg metformin XR, and 10 mg dapagliflozin and 
      1000 mg metformin XR) were evaluated in fed and fasted states. FINDINGS: Under 
      fed and fasted conditions the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 500 mg metformin XR FDC 
      showed bioequivalence to its ICs. The 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin 
      XR FDC was bioequivalent to its ICs in fed subjects. Although AUC for the 10 mg 
      dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin XR FDC was bioequivalent in fasted subjects, 
      the Cmax for metformin was not bioequivalent to its ICs in fasted subjects (upper 
      90% CI was 127.5%, and thus outside the 80%-125% bioequivalence interval). The 
      small increase in the fasted state is not considered clinically meaningful due to 
      the small magnitude of the difference (9.2%), the lack of metformin Cmax being 
      associated with efficacy or tolerability concerns, and the fasted state not being 
      the recommended state for dosing of metformin XR. The safety profile and 
      tolerability of the FDCs were similar to those of their ICs and no deaths or 
      serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: Both FDCs of dapagliflozin 
      and metformin XR were bioequivalent to their ICs in fed and fasted subjects, 
      except for the metformin Cmax from the 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin 
      XR FDC in fasted subjects. These data support the use of a dapagliflozin and 
      metformin XR FDC in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Discovery of ACH-000143: A Novel Potent and Peripherally Preferred Melatonin 
      Receptor Agonist that Reduces Liver Triglycerides and Steatosis in Diet-Induced 
      Obese Rats.

AB  - The modulation of melatonin signaling in peripheral tissues holds promise for 
      treating metabolic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis. Here, several benzimidazole derivatives have been identified as 
      novel agonists of the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2. The lead compounds 10b, 
      15a, and 19a demonstrated subnanomolar potency at MT1/MT2 receptors, high oral 
      bioavailability in rodents, peripherally preferred exposure, and excellent 
      selectivity in a broad panel of targets. Two-month oral administration of 10b in 
      high-fat diet rats led to a reduction in body weight gain similar to 
      dapagliflozin with superior results on hepatic steatosis and triglyceride levels. 
      An early toxicological assessment indicated that 10b (also codified as 
      ACH-000143) was devoid of hERG binding, genotoxicity, and behavioral alterations 
      at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o., supporting further investigation of this compound 
      as a drug candidate.

TI  - New spectrofluorimetric analysis of dapagliflozin after derivatization with 
      NBD-Cl in human plasma using factorial design experiments.
PG  - 576-584
LID - 10.1002/bio.3640 [doi]
AB  - A new validated spectrofluorimetric method was proposed for dapagliflozin (DGF) 
      analysis in bulk, plexin its commercially available tablets and in spiked human 
      plasma. The proposed spectrofluorimetric method depended on the formation of a 
      fluorescent complex soluble in organic liquids by a substitution reaction between 
      4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) reagent and DGF in aqueous 
      buffered solution at pH 7. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 522 nm 
      after excitation at 453 nm. The high selectivity of the proposed method allowed 
      analysis of DGF in dosage form and human plasma samples with average recovery 
      values of 99.84 ± 1.38% and 98.71 ± 1.80%, respectively, without any interference 
      from matrix components. The calibration range was 50-1000 ng ml(-1) . The limit 
      of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 14.24 ng ml(-1) and 
      43.14 ng ml(-1) , respectively. The estimated relative standard deviation values 
      were lower than 2.0%, this showed the excellent precision at both levels. 
      Factorial design was used to get the optimum method conditions for the analysis 
      of the resulting DGF fluorescence complex in different matrices. The proposed 
      method could be used in routine analysis of DGF in quality control laboratories. 
      Also, it could be used to assay DGF in human plasma and be applied for 
      pharmacokinetic investigation of DGF.
