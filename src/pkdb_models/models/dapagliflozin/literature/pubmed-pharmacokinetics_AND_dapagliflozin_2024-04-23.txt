TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a selective 
      inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2.
PG  - 17-27

AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is predominantly expressed in the S1 
      segment of the proximal tubule of the kidney and is the major transporter 
      responsible for mediating renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin is an orally 
      active, highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by reducing renal glucose 
      reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion (glucuresis). Orally 
      administered dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed generally achieving peak plasma 
      concentrations within 2 h. Dose-proportional systemic exposure to dapagliflozin 
      has been observed over a wide dose range (0.1-500 mg) with an oral 
      bioavailability of 78 %. Dapagliflozin has extensive extravascular distribution 
      (mean volume of distribution of 118 L). Dapagliflozin metabolism occurs 
      predominantly in the liver and kidneys by uridine 
      diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A9 to the major metabolite dapagliflozin 
      3-O-glucuronide (this metabolite is not an SGLT2 inhibitor at clinically relevant 
      exposures). Dapagliflozin is not appreciably cleared by renal excretion (<2 % of 
      dose is recovered in urine as parent). Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide elimination 
      occurs mainly via renal excretion, with 61 % of a dapagliflozin dose being 
      recovered as this metabolite in urine. The half-life for orally administered 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg was 12.9 h. Maximal increases in urinary glucose excretion 
      were seen at doses ≥20 mg/day in patients with T2DM. No clinically relevant 
      differences were observed in dapagliflozin exposure with respect to age, race, 
      sex, body weight, food, or presence of T2DM. Pharmacodynamic changes are 
      dependent on plasma glucose and renal function, and decreases in urinary glucose 
      excretion were observed due to the lower filtered load (plasma glucose × 
      glomerular filtration rate) in healthy volunteers compared to subjects with T2DM. 
      After multiple doses of dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion was associated 
      with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose parameters in subjects with T2DM. 
      Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment show higher systemic exposure to 
      dapagliflozin. No clinically relevant drug interactions were observed that would 
      necessitate dose adjustment of dapagliflozin when administered with other 
      antidiabetic or cardiovascular medications, as well as drugs that could 
      potentially influence dapagliflozin metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors attenuate incident 
      cardiovascular outcomes, irrespective of baseline GFR, in conservatively managed 
      CKD. As this condition inexorably progresses to demanding KRT, drug withdrawal is 
      supported by the current lack of evidence of safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in 
      dialysis. METHODS: This study was a prospective, single-center, open-label trial 
      ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05343078 ) aimed at assessing the 
      pharmacokinetic properties and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with kidney 
      failure on regular dialysis regimens compared with those with type 2 diabetes and 
      age- and sex-matched controls with normal kidney function. Peripheral blood 
      samples were collected from both groups every 30 minutes for 4 hours and again 
      after 48 hours after ingestion of dapagliflozin 10 mg, which occurred immediately 
      before dialysis session initiation in the kidney failure group. This protocol 
      occurred in drug-naïve patients and again after six daily doses of dapagliflozin 
      to assess whether the drug had accumulated. The plasma and dialysate levels of 
      dapagliflozin at each time point were determined by liquid chromatography and 
      used to calculate pharmacokinetics parameters (peak concentration [C max ] and 
      area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve) for each participant. 
      RESULTS: Dapagliflozin C max was 117 and 97.6 ng/ml in the kidney failure and 
      control groups, respectively, whereas the corresponding accumulation ratios were 
      26.7% and 9.5%. No serious adverse events were reported for either group. 
      Dapagliflozin recovered from dialysate corresponded to 0.10% of the administered 
      dose. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with kidney failure on dialysis, dapagliflozin was 
      well tolerated, was slightly dialyzable, and had nonaccumulating pharmacokinetic 
      properties. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Dapagliflozin: A Review in Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 1135-1146
LID - 10.1007/s40265-019-01148-3 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin (Forxiga(®)) is a highly potent, reversible and selective 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor indicated worldwide for the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the EU, oral dapagliflozin once daily is approved for 
      use as monotherapy (in patients who are intolerant of metformin) and as add-on 
      combination therapy (with other glucose-lowering agents, including insulin) for 
      T2D when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. In 
      numerous well-designed clinical studies and their extensions, dapagliflozin as 
      monotherapy and combination therapy with other antihyperglycaemic agents provided 
      effective glycaemic control and reduced bodyweight and blood pressure (BP) across 
      a broad spectrum of patients. Dapagliflozin reduced the rate of cardiovascular 
      (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), did not adversely affect 
      major adverse CV events (MACE) and possibly reduced progression of renal disease 
      relative to placebo in patients with established atherosclerotic CV disease (CVD) 
      or multiple risk factors for CVD. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated, 
      with a low risk of hypoglycaemia; diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), although rare, and 
      genital infections were more common with dapagliflozin than placebo. Given its 
      antihyperglycaemic, cardioprotective and possibly renoprotective properties and 
      generally favourable tolerability profile, dapagliflozin provides an important 
      option for the management of a broad patient population, regardless of the 
      history of CVD.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: the latest developments.
PG  - 1287-1302
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2018.1551877 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder associated with 
      high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Some of the therapeutic strategies are 
      contraindicated in patients with concomitant heart disease. However, the newest 
      antidiabetic medications, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have 
      shown to significantly reduce CV mortality and heart failure (HF) 
      hospitalizations. The mechanism behind these surprising cardiac benefits remains 
      unclear. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacokinetic, 
      pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety data for the different SGLT2 inhibitors. 
      Specific attention is devoted to the postulated mechanisms of action for their 
      benefit. The therapeutic efficacy and potential use in different indications 
      outside T2DM such as HF, T1DM, and renal disease are also discussed. Expert 
      opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors have an excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      profile. Importantly, SGLT2 inhibitors are a safe and efficacious treatment 
      option for T2DM. Given their cardiac benefits (reduction in HF and death) and the 
      low incidence of adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors are being currently studied as 
      a treatment for HF also in nondiabetic individuals. These agents seem to 
      represent a shift in the treatment of HF patients regardless their glycemic 
      profile.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Pharmacokinetics Is Similar in Adults With Type 1 and Type 2 
      Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 1227-1235
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2062 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) and is approved in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 
      with inadequate glycemic control. The objectives of this work were to 
      characterize the dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with T1DM, 
      assess the influence of covariates on dapagliflozin PK, and compare dapagliflozin 
      systemic exposure between patients with T1DM and T2DM. Population PK analysis was 
      performed using a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. The analysis included 
      5793 dapagliflozin plasma concentrations from 1150 adult patients with T1DM 
      (global population), who were on routine insulin therapy, collected from 1 phase 
      2 (NCT01498185) and 2 phase 3 (DEPICT-1, NCT02268214; DEPICT-2, NCT02460978) 
      studies. Covariate effects were investigated using stepwise covariate modeling. 
      Model-derived area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in patients with T1DM 
      was compared to AUC in patients with T2DM (using data from historical 
      dapagliflozin studies). The final 2-compartmental model adequately described the 
      dapagliflozin concentrations in patients with T1DM. The estimated apparent 
      clearance was 20.5 L/h. Renal function (measured as estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate), sex, and body weight were identified as covariates, where 
      patients with better renal function, male patients, and heavier patients had 
      lower dapagliflozin systemic exposure. Among the covariates studied, none of the 
      covariates affected dapagliflozin systemic exposure >1.4-fold compared to a 
      reference individual and were therefore deemed to be not clinically relevant. 
      Dapagliflozin systemic exposure was comparable between patients with T1DM and 
      T2DM.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in combination with

AB  - AIMS: To assess the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of dapagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor that increases urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE) and its major metabolite, dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), 
      in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and inadequate glycaemic control 
      (HbA1c 7%-10%). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese patients (18-65 years) with 
      inadequately controlled T1D were randomized 1:1:1 to dapagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg or 
      placebo (n = 14 each) once daily for 7 days, with adjustable insulin. The PK/PD 
      characteristics of dapagliflozin and D3OG were assessed on Day 7. Patients 
      underwent follow-up evaluation on Days 8 and 14. Adverse events (AEs), 
      hypoglycaemic episodes and events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were recorded 
      over the treatment and follow-up periods. RESULTS: A total of 42 randomized 
      patients received dapagliflozin or placebo. PK variables increased in a 
      dose-dependent manner. D3OG was generated rapidly, with a median time to maximum 
      plasma concentration of 2.0 hours (1.0-3.0). The dapagliflozin dose-UGE 
      relationship was attenuated, with larger insulin dose reductions than 
      anticipated. Mean percent (standard error) changes in total daily insulin dose 
      from baseline to Day 7 were - 36.86% (3.32), -39.13% (2.68) and - 4.97% (5.28) 
      for dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg and for placebo, respectively. No DKA was 
      reported. AEs were consistent with the established dapagliflozin safety profile. 
      There was no increase in hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The PK and safety profiles 
      of dapagliflozin in Japanese patients with T1D were consistent with previous 
      studies, but with an unanticipated attenuation of the PD dose-response measured 
      as UGE.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dapagliflozin (DAPA) (Farxiga or Forxiga) is a sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) 
      treatment. AREAS COVERED: The review focuses on the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
      pharmacodynamics(PD) and clinical studies published on DAPA. The authors searched 
      PubMed database for English language studies describing DAPA characteristics and 
      use in T2DM subjects published through June 2014. EXPERT OPINION: DAPA exhibits 
      favorable PK and PD properties and is effective in reducing glycemic levels. In 
      addition, DAPA shows beneficial/neutral effects on other risk factors 
      contributing to T2DM metabolic control. Increased risk of genital and urinary 
      infections and episodes of volume depletion represent the major concerns for its 
      use. FDA requires additional data to assess imbalances in bladder cancer and drug 
      cardiovascular safety. The mechanism of action and the very low risk of drug-drug 
      interaction make it an ideal drug for rapidly reducing glucotoxicity and 
      restoring clinical response to other antidiabetic drugs.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety 
      profile of dapagliflozin in paediatric patients aged 10-17 years with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Patients were randomized to a single oral dose 
      of dapagliflozin 2.5, 5 or 10 mg. The PK characteristics for individual patients 
      were derived by non-compartmental methods. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE), 
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and ease of swallowing were also evaluated. RESULTS: 
      A total of 24 patients with a mean (range) body weight of 99.7 (61.5-169.5) kg 
      received dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed after oral 
      administration (median time to maximum plasma concentration ∼1.5 h) and systemic 
      exposures to dapagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite appeared 
      dose-proportional. The mean 24-h UGE increased in a dose-related manner (52.8, 
      62.4 and 89.0 g for the 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). Mean FPG 
      concentrations were lower for all dose groups on day 2 (6.9, 6.2 and 6.8 mmol/l 
      for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively) than they were predose on day 1 (9.5, 
      8.5 and 8.2 mmol/l for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively). Six patients (25%) 
      experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), however, there was no dose-related pattern. 
      All AEs occurred only once and most were mild in intensity. Nearly all patients 
      (n = 23; 95.8%) reported easy swallowing of the dapagliflozin tablets. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well tolerated in this paediatric population, with 
      no significant safety findings. PK/PD characteristics were similar to those 
      observed in adults with T2DM, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the same 
      dapagliflozin dosage as that used in adults can be evaluated in future phase III 
      paediatric studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of a Fixed-Dose Combination Product of Dapagliflozin and 
      Linagliptin and Its Comparison with Co-Administration of Individual Tablets in 
      Healthy Humans.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14030591 [doi]
LID - 591
AB  - Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, and 
      linagliptin, a competitive, reversible dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, are 
      commonly prescribed antidiabetic medications in general clinics. Since there are 
      several merits to combining them in a fixed-dose combination product, this study 
      investigated the pharmacokinetic equivalence between the individual component 
      (IC) and fixed-combination drug product (FCDP) forms of dapagliflozin and 
      linagliptin. A randomized, open-label, single-dose crossover study was conducted. 
      All participants (n = 48) were randomly allocated to group A (period 1: ICs, 
      period 2: FCDP) or group B (period 1: FCDP, period 2: ICs), and each group 
      received either a single dose of IN-C009 (FCDP) or single doses of both 
      dapagliflozin and linagliptin. There was no statistically significant difference 
      found between the pharmacokinetic variables of FCDP and IC. The values of 
      estimated geometric mean ratios and the 90% confidence interval for both maximum 
      concentration and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve were within 
      the range of 0.8-1.25 for both dapagliflozin and linagliptin. The results of the 
      clinical study demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetic characteristics between IC 
      and FCDP forms of dapagliflozin and linagliptin. The combined use of 
      dapagliflozin and linagliptin was safe and tolerable in both formulations.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem, affecting about 10% of the 
      population. Pharmacotherapy aims to protect against microvascular complications, 
      including blindness, end-stage kidney disease, and amputations. Landmark clinical 
      trials have demonstrated that intensive glycemic control slows progression of 
      microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Long-term 
      follow-up has demonstrated that intensive glycemic control also decreases risk of 
      macrovascular disease, albeit rigorous evidence of macrovascular benefit did not 
      emerge for over a decade. The US FDA's recent requirement for dedicated 
      cardiovascular outcome trials ushered in a golden age for understanding the 
      clinical profiles of new type 2 diabetes drugs. Some clinical trials with 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 
      (GLP1) receptor agonists reported data demonstrating cardiovascular benefit 
      (decreased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for 
      heart failure) and slower progression of diabetic kidney disease. This Review 
      discusses current guidelines for use of the 12 classes of drugs approved to 
      promote glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Review also 
      anticipates future developments with potential to improve the standard of care: 
      availability of generic dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and SGLT2 
      inhibitors; precision medicine to identify the best drugs for individual 
      patients; and new therapies to protect against chronic complications of diabetes.

AB  - Saxagliptin (a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, DPP-4i) and dapagliflozin (a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor, SGLT2i) improve glucose control in 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) through different potentially complementary mechanisms, 
      thus offering the opportunity for a combined therapy. Area covered: The 
      characteristics of the saxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination are analysed, 
      focusing on: 1) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties; 2) efficacy and 
      safety in phase III trials with concurrent and sequential add-on therapy; and 3) 
      potential use in clinical practice, including in special populations 
      (cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, elderly). Expert 
      commentary: Conclusions drawn from clinical trials investigating combination with 
      the separate drugs are considered to apply to the fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      that demonstrates bioequivalence. Dual saxagliptin/dapagliflozin therapy is more 
      potent than either monotherapy and can be used as an initial combination or a 
      stepwise sequential approach. Dual therapy is generally well tolerated and may be 
      used in special populations, with some limitations because of the presence of 
      dapagliflozin. However, the latter may offer some advantages because of multiple 
      effects attributed to SGLT2i. The best place of this dual combination for the 
      management of T2D and the profile of patients who will make the most of this 
      combined therapy remains to be defined.

TI  - Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response Relationship of 
      Dapagliflozin in Patients without Diabetes and with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 517-525
LID - 10.1007/s40262-020-00956-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 
      inhibitor, was originally developed as an oral glucose-lowering drug for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Emerging data suggest that cardiovascular 
      and kidney benefits extend to patients without diabetes. Limited pharmacological 
      data are, however, available in patients without diabetes. We aimed to 
      characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of dapagliflozin in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Plasma samples were 
      collected in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial 
      (DIAMOND, NCT03190694, n = 53) that assessed the effects of 10 mg of 
      dapagliflozin in patients with a glomerular filtration rate ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m(2) 
      and proteinuria > 500 mg/day. Mixed-effects models were used to develop a 
      pharmacokinetic model and to evaluate the association between plasma exposure and 
      response. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations (n = 430 observations) from 48 patients 
      (mean age 50.8 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 57.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 
      median proteinuria 1115 mg/24 h) were best described using a two-compartment 
      model with first-order elimination. Apparent clearance and volume of distribution 
      were 11.7 (95% confidence interval 10.7-12.7) L/h and 44.9 (95% confidence 
      interval 39.0-50.9) L, respectively. Median dapagliflozin plasma exposure was 
      740.9 ng h/mL (2.5th-97.5th percentiles: 434.0-1615.3). Plasma exposure increased 
      with decreasing kidney function. Every 100-ng h/mL increment in dapagliflozin 
      plasma exposure was associated with a decrease in the urinary albumin:creatinine 
      ratio (β = - 2.8%, p = 0.01), glomerular filtration rate (β = - 0.5 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2), p < 0.01) and systolic blood pressure (β = - 0.4 mmHg, p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The dapagliflozin plasma concentration-time profile in patients with 
      non-diabetic kidney disease appears similar to the profile of patients with 
      diabetic kidney disease described in the literature. Furthermore, the plasma 
      exposure was associated with changes in risk markers for kidney disease.

AB  - Dapagliflozin base and a commercial dapagliflozin propanediol hydrate cocrystal 
      (DPF-PDHC) were highly hygroscopic and thermally unstable. In this study, to 
      address this limitation, we prepared a novel dapagliflozin di-L-proline cocrystal 
      (DPF-LPC) and evaluated its physicochemical characterization compared with 
      DPF-PDHC. After the preparation of the DPF-LPC-loaded tablet, its dissolution, 
      stability and bioequivalence in beagle dogs and mini-pigs were assessed. DPF-LPC 
      was well prepared with a dapagliflozin base and L-proline in a molar ratio of 
      1:2. Similar to DPF-PDHC, DPF-LPC was highly lipophilic and crystalline in 
      nature. However, these two cocrystals exhibited different melting points and 
      crystalline structures, indicating their different cocrystal forms. Moreover, 
      DPF-LPC exhibited less hygroscopicity and lower water content than DPF-PDHC. The 
      DPF-LPC-loaded tablet composed of DPF-LPC, Comprecel M102, lactose monohydrate, 
      crospovidone, magnesium stearate, and Opadry (coating) at a weight ratio of 
      15.6:104.4:100.0:8.0:2.0:7.0, was dissolution-equivalent to the commercial 
      tablet. Moreover, it provided lower impurities than the commercial tablet, 
      indicating its better stability. In the two animals, there were no significant 
      differences in the plasma concentrations, AUC, C(max), and T(max) values, 
      suggesting that they were bioequivalent. Therefore, the novel DPF-LPC-loaded 
      tablet with excellent stability and bioequivalence may be used as a potential 
      alternative to the commercial DPF-PDHC-loaded tablet.

AB  - PURPOSE: A fixed-dose combination (FDC) product combining dapagliflozin and 
      metformin may increase medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) by minimizing pill burden associated with co-administration of 
      individual component (IC) formulations and, consequently, improve cost-efficiency 
      and compliance. This study evaluated the bioequivalence of the 
      dapagliflozin/metformin FDC product versus IC administration in healthy 
      volunteers from a Chinese population and assessed the safety profile of the FDC 
      product. In addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety comparisons of 
      dapagliflozin and metformin across different regions were conducted to evaluate 
      regional differences. METHODS: This single-center, open-label, parallel-cohort, 
      randomized, 2-period, crossover study enrolled Chinese adults (aged 18-55 years). 
      Volunteers in cohort 1 received either a single FDC tablet of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin extended release (XR) (5/500 mg) or IC tablets 
      (dapagliflozin [5 mg] and metformin XR [500 mg]). Volunteers in cohort 2 received 
      a higher dosage in a similar manner (dapagliflozin [10 mg] and metformin XR [1000 
      mg]). Volunteers in each cohort were subsequently crossed over to receive the 
      alternate cohort treatment. Plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin and metformin 
      were determined, and bioequivalence analyses were performed under standard fed 
      conditions. FINDINGS: Eighty healthy Chinese volunteers (89.9% male; mean age, 
      28.7 years) were randomized into cohort 1 (n = 40) and cohort 2 (n = 39; 1 
      volunteer withdrew before receiving study treatment). The mean plasma 
      concentration-time profiles of the dapagliflozin and metformin FDC and IC 
      formulations for both doses were found to be nearly superimposable. Dapagliflozin 
      and metformin XR FDC were bioequivalent to the IC tablets, with 90% CIs for each 
      pairwise comparison contained within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence limits. Both 
      the FDC and IC formulations were well tolerated, with no serious adverse 
      events/death. PK parameters for dapagliflozin in the Chinese volunteers were 
      slightly to moderately higher than those from studies conducted in Brazil, 
      Russia, and the United States, and the safety profile of the 
      dapagliflozin/metformin FDC product was consistent with that of other studies. 
      The difference in PK parameters among the 4 regions was not clinically 
      meaningful. IMPLICATIONS: The bioequivalence of the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC 
      and IC formulations in healthy Chinese adults was established without any new 
      safety concerns. Notably, the observed bioequivalence may be extrapolated to 
      patients with T2DM as the PK parameters of dapagliflozin and metformin in healthy 
      adults are similar to those reported in patients with T2DM. CLINICALTRIALS: gov

TI  - Comparative Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of a Novel Sodium-Glucose 
      Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor, DWP16001, with Dapagliflozin and Ipragliflozin.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12030268 [doi]
LID - 268
AB  - Since sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduced blood glucose 
      level by inhibiting renal tubular glucose reabsorption mediated by SGLT2, we 
      aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and kidney distribution of DWP16001, a 
      novel SGLT2 inhibitor, and to compare these properties with those of 
      dapagliflozin and ipragliflozin, representative SGLT2 inhibitors. The plasma 
      exposure of DWP16001 was comparable with that of ipragliflozin but higher than 
      that of dapagliflozin. DWP16001 showed the highest kidney distribution among 
      three SGLT2 inhibitors when expressed as an area under curve (AUC) ratio of 
      kidney to plasma (85.0 ± 16.1 for DWP16001, 64.6 ± 31.8 for dapagliflozin and 
      38.4 ± 5.3 for ipragliflozin). The organic anion transporter-mediated kidney 
      uptake of DWP16001 could be partly attributed to the highest kidney uptake. 
      Additionally, DWP16001 had the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration 
      (IC(50)) to SGLT2, a target transporter (0.8 ± 0.3 nM for DWP16001, 1.6 ± 0.3 nM 
      for dapagliflozin, and 8.9 ± 1.7 nM for ipragliflozin). The inhibition mode of 
      DWP16001 on SGLT2 was reversible and competitive, but the recovery of the SGLT2 
      inhibition after the removal of SGLT2 inhibitors in CHO cells overexpressing 
      SGLT2 was retained with DWP16001, which is not the case with dapagliflozin and 
      ipragliflozin. In conclusion, selective and competitive SGLT2 inhibition of 
      DWP16001 could potentiate the efficacy of DWP16001 in coordination with the 
      higher kidney distribution and retained SGLT2 inhibition of DWP16001 relative to 
      dapagliflozin and ipragliflozin.

AB  - AIMS: To compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) versus type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) in order to explore the potential of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to 
      insulin in patients with T1DM. METHODS: Steady-state pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin (1-100 mg) were evaluated in a meta-analysis of 
      patients with T1DM or T2DM. A model was constructed of the relationship between 
      dapagliflozin systemic exposure and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) in patients 
      with T1DM versus those with T2DM. RESULTS: Data were analysed from 160 patients 
      (T1DM, n = 70; T2DM, n = 90). Dapagliflozin systemic exposure (maximum 
      concentration and area under the curve) increased similarly in a dose-related 
      manner in both patient populations. Dose-dependent increases in 24-h UGE were 
      observed with dapagliflozin in both populations. Unadjusted results showed that 
      with regard to UGE response, dapagliflozin was more potent in patients with T1DM 
      {mean half-maximum effective concentration [EC50 ] = 2.72 ng/ml [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.14, 5.08]} than in patients with T2DM [EC50  = 12.2 ng/ml (95% CI 
      4.91, 21.1)]. After normalization for baseline fasting plasma glucose, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate and UGE, however, the UGE potency of dapagliflozin was 
      similar between the two populations [T1DM: mean EC50 , 8.12 ng/ml (95% CI 2.95, 
      14.6); T2DM: mean EC50 , 7.75 ng/ml (95% CI 1.35, 18.1)]. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics and the predicted UGE dose exposure response to 
      dapagliflozin were similar in patients with T1DM and those with T2DM and suggest 
      that the dapagliflozin dosages currently used for the treatment of T2DM may 
      provide benefit as add-on therapy to insulin in patients with T1DM.

TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics and the exposure-response relationship of 
      dapagliflozin between adolescent/young adult and adult patients with type 1 
      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1820-1828
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13981 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To quantitatively compare pharmacokinetics (PK) and the exposure-response 
      (ER) relationship of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, 
      between adolescents/young adults and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 
      METHODS: Data from 2 clinical studies for dapagliflozin were analysed using a 
      non-linear mixed-effects approach. The PK and the relationship between 
      dapagliflozin exposure and response (24-hour urinary glucose excretion) were 
      characterized. PK was evaluated using a 2-compartment model with first-order 
      absorption while the exposure response-relationship was analysed using a 
      sigmoidal maximal-effect model. The 24-hour median blood glucose, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), sex, age and body weight were evaluated as 
      covariates. RESULTS: A 2-compartment model with first order absorption provided a 
      reasonable fit to the dapagliflozin PK data. Body weight was found to be a 
      significant covariate on dapagliflozin exposure. The ER relationship was best 
      described by a sigmoidal maximal effect model with 24-hour median blood glucose 
      and eGFR as significant covariates on maximal effect. In accordance with the 
      observed data, model-predicted urinary glucose excretion response following 10 mg 
      dapagliflozin dose was higher in the study in adolescents/young adults 
      (138.0 g/24 h) compared to adults (70.5 g/24 h) with T1DM. This is linked to 
      higher eGFR and 24-hour median blood glucose in this trial. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dapagliflozin PK and ER relationship were similar in the 2 analysed studies after 
      accounting for covariate effects. These results suggest that no dose adjustment 
      is required for adolescent patients with T1DM.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a greatly challenging disease of the 21 century, and the 
      mortality rate due to this insidious disease is increasing worldwide in spite of 
      availability of effective oral hypoglycemic agents. Satisfactory management of 
      glycemic control in patients afflicted with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      remains a major clinical challenge. Identification of potential pharmacological 
      target sites is therefore continuing as an integral part of the diabetic 
      research. The sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) expressed in the renal 
      proximal tubule plays an essential role in glucose reabsorption. Pharmacological 
      blockade of SGLT2 prevents glucose reabsorption and subsequently induces the 
      elimination of filtered glucose via urine, the process is known as 'glucuresis'. 
      Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of SGLT2. The US FDA approved 
      dapagliflozin in January 2014 to improve glycemic control along with diet and 
      exercise in adult patients afflicted with T2DM. It has a potential to decrease 
      glycated hemoglobin and to promote weight loss. Although the mechanism of action 
      of dapagliflozin is not directly linked with insulin or insulin sensitivity, 
      reduction of plasma glucose by dapagliflozin via induction of glucosuria could 
      improve muscle insulin sensitivity. Moreover, dapagliflozin could cause diuresis 
      and subsequently fall in blood pressure. In addition to general discussion on the 
      pharmacology of dapagliflozin, we propose in this review the possibilities of 
      dual antidiabetic effect of dapagliflozin and its possible additional beneficial 
      actions in hypertensive-obese-T2DM patients through its indirect blood 
      pressure-lowering action and reduction of body calories and weight. Long-term 
      clinical studies are however needed to clarify this contention.

      dapagliflozin, donafenib and canagliflozin in rats.

AB  - Donafenib (DONA), a deuterium derivative of sorafenib, is used for advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dapagliflozin (DAPA) and canagliflozin (CANA) are 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors used for T2DM, which is 
      frequently comorbid with HCC. Three drugs are substrates of UGT1A9 isoenzyme. 
      This study aimed to evaluate donafenib-dapagliflozin and donafenib-canagliflozin 
      pharmacokinetic interactions and explore the potential mechanisms. Rats were 
      divided into seven groups (n = 6) that received donafenib (1), dapagliflozin (2), 
      canagliflozin (3), dapagliflozin and donafenib (4), canagliflozin and donafenib 
      (5), donafenib and dapagliflozin (6), donafenib and canagliflozin (7). The 
      concentrations of drugs were determined by an ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. The messenger RNA 
      (mRNA) expressions were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Multiple doses of 
      dapagliflozin caused donafenib maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) to increase 
      37.01%. Canagliflozin increased donafenib C(max) 1.77-fold and the area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(0-t) and AUC(inf)) 1.39- and 1.41-fold, 
      respectively, while reducing the apparent clearance (CL(z)) 28.38%. Multiple 
      doses of donafenib increased dapagliflozin AUC(0-t) 1.61-fold, AUC(inf) 
      1.77-fold, whereas its CL(z) reduced 40.50%. Furthermore, donafenib caused 
      similar changes in canagliflozin pharmacokinetics. The PCR results demonstrated 
      that dapagliflozin inhibited the mRNA expression of Ugt1a7 in liver and donafenib 
      decreased the expression of Ugt1a7 mRNA in liver and intestine. Increased 
      exposure to these drugs may be due to their metabolism inhibition mediated by 
      Ugt1a7. These pharmacokinetic interactions observed in this study may be of 
      clinical significance, which may help adjust dose properly and avoid toxicity 
      effects in patients with HCC and T2DM.

AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitor that decreases serum glucose by reducing renal glucose reabsorption, 
      thereby promoting urinary glucose excretion. Dapagliflozin is primarily 
      metabolized via the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 pathway 
      to its major inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the potential for drug-drug interaction between 
      dapagliflozin and two potential UGT1A9 modulators. METHODS: The results of two 
      open-label, non-randomized, single-sequence studies are reported in which the 
      effects of rifampin (a pleiotropic drug-metabolizing enzyme inducer; study 1) and 
      mefenamic acid (a strong UGT1A9 inhibitor; study 2) were evaluated on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (assessed by urinary glucose excretion 
      [UGE]) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. In study 1, 14 subjects received 
      single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg alone and in the presence of rifampin 600 mg 
      QD (6 days). In study 2, 16 subjects received single doses of dapagliflozin 10 mg 
      alone and in the presence of mefenamic acid 250 mg q6h (5 days). RESULTS: 
      Rifampin reduced total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from 
      time 0 to infinity [AUC0-inf]) to dapagliflozin by 22% and mefenamic acid 
      increased dapagliflozin AUC0-inf by 51%. No clinically meaningful effect of 
      rifampin or mefenamic acid on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin or on 
      dapagliflozin-mediated urinary glucose excretion was observed. CONCLUSION: Modest 
      changes in dapagliflozin exposure were seen with rifampin and mefenamic acid with 
      minor changes in UGE, none of which were considered clinically meaningful.

TI  - A Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Dapagliflozin Formate, an

      Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 1203-1210
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S404182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin formate (DAP-FOR, DA-2811), an ester prodrug of 
      dapagliflozin, was developed to improve the stability and pharmaceutical 
      manufacturing process of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibitor. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and 
      safety of dapagliflozin for DAP-FOR compared to those for dapagliflozin 
      propanediol monohydrate (DAP-PDH, Forxiga) in healthy subjects. METHODS: This was 
      an open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence crossover study. 
      The subjects received a single dose of DAP-FOR or DAP-PDH 10 mg in each period, 
      with a 7-day washout. Serial blood samples for PK analysis were collected up to 
      48 hours after a single administration to determine plasma concentrations of 
      DAP-FOR and dapagliflozin. PK parameters were calculated using a 
      non-compartmental method and compared between the two drugs. RESULTS: In total, 
      28 subjects completed the study. DAP-FOR plasma concentrations were not detected 
      in all of the blood sampling time points except for one time point in one 
      subject, and the corresponding DAP-FOR plasma concentration in the subject was 
      close to the lower limit of quantification. The mean plasma concentration-time 
      profiles of dapagliflozin were comparable between the two drugs. The geometric 
      mean ratios and its 90% confidence intervals of the maximum plasma concentration 
      and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of dapagliflozin for DAP-FOR 
      to DAP-PDH were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 0.80-1.25. Both 
      drugs were well-tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse drug reactions. 
      CONCLUSION: The rapid conversion of DAP-FOR into dapagliflozin led to the 
      extremely low exposure of DAP-FOR and comparable PK profiles of dapagliflozin 
      between DAP-FOR and DAP-PDH. The safety profiles were also similar between the 
      two drugs. These results suggest that DAP-FOR can be used as an alternative to 
      DAP-PDH.

TI  - Dapagliflozin twice daily or once daily: effect on pharmacokinetics and urinary 
      glucose excretion in healthy subjects.
PG  - 423-5
LID - 10.1111/dom.12425 [doi]
AB  - The primary objective of this single-centre, open-label crossover study 
      (NCT01072578) was to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on the amount of glucose 
      in the blood and urine in healthy volunteers when dapagliflozin was administered 
      once a day (10 mg) versus twice a day (5 mg every 12 h) after 5 days of dosing. 
      At steady state, the AUC(ss)₀₋₂₄ (area under the dapagliflozin curve (0-24 hours) 
      at steady state), C(ss,av) (average concentration at steady state) between 
      dapagliflozin 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg once daily were similar AUC(ss)₀₋₂₄ [5 
      mg bid, (458.0 (28.7)) and 10 mg qd, (470.0 (28.5))] and C(ss,av) [5 mg bid 18.8 
      (28.9)) and 10 mg qd, (19.6(28.5))], but minimum and maximum plasma levels of 
      dapagliflozin differed significantly. Percent inhibition of renal glucose 
      reabsorption (%IRGRA) and total urinary glucose excretion over 24 h were similar 
      for both doses. The relationship between the mean dapagliflozin concentration and 
      %IRGRA and the total urinary glucose excreted was well described by a maximum 
      effect model. The results indicate that dapagliflozin may be used for either once 
      daily or twice daily administration.

TI  - Dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics is similar between patients with heart failure 
      with reduced ejection fraction and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 606-612
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15939 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin was recently approved for use in adults with chronic heart failure 
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with/without type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). The objectives of this analysis were to characterize dapagliflozin 
      pharmacokinetics in patients with HFrEF and to compare dapagliflozin systemic 
      exposure between adults with HFrEF with/without T2DM and adults with T2DM. A 
      nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach was applied; the 
      population-pharmacokinetic model was developed using 9735 dapagliflozin plasma 
      concentrations from 2744 patients. The final two-compartmental model adequately 
      described the observed dapagliflozin concentrations, with a similar estimated 
      apparent clearance compared with a previous estimate in patients with T2DM 
      without HF and in healthy subjects (23.0 [95% CI: 22.6-23.9] L/h vs. 22.9 [95% 
      CI: 22.1-23.7] L/h). The model-predicted median area under the dapagliflozin 
      concentration-time profile was ≤1.2-fold higher in patients with HFrEF vs. those 
      with T2DM without HFrEF, which is not considered clinically relevant. 
      Dapagliflozin exposure was similar between patients with HFrEF with/without T2DM 
      and T2DM patients without HFrEF.

TI  - Improved Manufacturability and In Vivo Comparative Pharmacokinetics of 
      Dapagliflozin Cocrystals in Beagle Dogs and Human Volunteers.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13010070 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - Dapagliflozin (DAP), which improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus, has poor physical properties against heat and moisture, thus 
      hindering its manufacturing potential. The superior physicochemical properties of 
      a recently developed cocrystal of DAP and citric acid (DAP cocrystal) in 
      comparison with those of DAP and Forxiga(®), a patented solvate form with 
      propandiol monohydrate, were identified via structural analysis and moisture 
      sorption isotherm. For the first time, the formulation, manufacturability, and in 
      vivo bioavailability of DAP cocrystals were successfully investigated to develop 
      oral dosage forms that substitute Forxiga(®). The intrinsic dissolution rate of 
      DAP cocrystal was controlled by varying particle size distribution. Unlike the 
      direct compression (DC), roller compaction (RC) was more preferable to obtain 
      good flowability of dry granules for a continuous manufacturing system. The 
      cocrystal structure was maintained throughout the stability assessment period. In 
      Vitro dissolution pattern differences of the optimized DAP cocrystal tablet with 
      RC and the reference tablet, Forxiga(®) 10 mg, were pharmaceutically equivalent 
      within 5% in four different media. Furthermore, comparative pharmacokinetic 
      analysis confirmed that a 10 mg DAP cocrystal tablet with RC was bioequivalent to 
      a 10 mg Forxiga(®) tablet, as assessed in beagle dogs and human volunteers.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a novel selective 
      inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2, in Japanese subjects without 
      and with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 357-65

AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin, a selective, orally active inhibitor of the renal 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) is in development for the treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of dapagliflozin were evaluated in healthy Japanese 
      subjects and in Japanese subjects with T2DM. METHODS: Two studies were conducted: 
      a single-ascending dose (SAD) study (2.5-50 mg) in 32 healthy subjects and a 
      multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study (2.5-20 mg QD for 14 days) in 36 subjects 
      with T2DM. Safety and tolerability were assessed in both studies. Single and 
      multiple dose PK of dapagliflozin and its inactive major metabolite, 
      dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, and PD (urinary glucose parameters) were 
      characterized. Plasma glucose parameters were assessed over 14 days in the MAD 
      study. RESULTS: No serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse 
      events occurred in either study. In healthy and T2DM subjects, dapagliflozin was 
      rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 0.5-1.3 h. 
      Systemic exposure of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, measured by 
      maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, 
      increased proportional to dose. On a molar basis, systemic exposure to 
      dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was similar to parent dapagliflozin. There was a 
      dose-related increase in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine (SAD and 
      MAD), which was associated with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose 
      parameters in subjects with T2DM (MAD). CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well 
      tolerated and showed predictable dose-proportional PK and PD parameters in both 
      healthy and T2DM Japanese subjects.

TI  - Evaluation of the Pharmacokinetics of Dapagliflozin in Patients With Chronic 
      Kidney Disease With or Without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 551-559
LID - 10.1002/jcph.2196 [doi]
AB  - Evidence shows that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, such as 
      dapagliflozin, can delay the progressive decline of kidney function in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We used a 
      population pharmacokinetics (popPK) model to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
      dapagliflozin in patients with CKD and compare dapagliflozin systemic exposure in 
      different populations, such as CKD with or without T2DM and T2DM without CKD. A 
      2-compartmental popPK model was developed from a previous popPK model. The final 
      popPK model was based on 9715 dapagliflozin plasma concentrations from 3055 
      patients included in clinical studies involving adults with CKD with or without 
      T2DM, adults with T2DM, healthy subjects, and pediatric patients with T2DM. 
      Overall, the apparent clearance for patients treated with dapagliflozin was 
      21.6 L/h, similar to previous estimates in adults with T2DM and healthy subjects 
      (22.9 L/h). Model-derived area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 
      was not meaningfully different between patients with CKD with and without T2DM. 
      Median AUC was 1.6-fold higher in adult patients with CKD with T2DM compared with 
      adult patients with T2DM without CKD. Compared with patients with normal kidney 
      function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ), median AUC 
      was 2.4-fold higher in patients with CKD (with/without T2DM) with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m(2) owing to decreased renal 
      clearance of dapagliflozin. A higher AUC was observed in patients with a higher 
      age or lower body weight but was not considered clinically relevant. This popPK 
      model adequately described dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics and found that systemic 
      exposure in patients with CKD was consistent, irrespective of T2DM status.

TI  - Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin in Paediatric Indications: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1007/s40272-024-00623-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In adults, sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors have 
      revolutionised the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and 
      chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review information on 
      compassionate use, clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of dapagliflozin 
      and empagliflozin in children. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of 
      published clinical trials, case reports, and observational studies in Medline, 
      Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases from inception to September 2023. 
      For the two randomised controlled trials on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we 
      implemented a meta-analysis on the primary outcome (mean difference in 
      glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] between intervention and placebo groups). Review 
      Manager (RevMan), version 5.4.1, was used for this purpose. RESULTS: Thirty-five 
      articles (nine case reports, ten case series, one prospective non-controlled 
      trial, four controlled randomised trials, two surveys, six pharmacokinetic 
      studies, and three pharmacovigilance studies) were selected, in which 415 
      children were exposed to either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin: 189 diabetic 
      patients (mean age 14.7 ± 2.9 years), 32 children with glycogen storage disease 
      type Ib (GSD Ib), glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3) deficiency, 
      or severe congenital neutropenia type 4 (8.5 ± 5.1 years), 47 children with 
      kidney disease or heart failure (11.2 ± 6.1 years), 84 patients in 
      pharmacokinetic studies (15.1 ± 2.3 years), and 63 patients in toxicological 
      series. The effect of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in T2DM was demonstrated by 
      HbA1c reduction in two randomised trials among a total of 177 adolescents, with a 
      mean HbA1c difference of -0.82% (95% confidence interval -1.34 to -0.29) as 
      compared to placebo (no heterogeneity, I(2) = 0%). Dosage ranged between 5 and 
      20 mg (mean 11.4 ± 3.7) once daily for dapagliflozin and between 5 and 25 mg 
      (mean 15.4 ± 7.4) once daily for empagliflozin. Among the paediatric cases of GSD 
      Ib, empagliflozin 0.1-1.3 mg/kg/day improved neutropenia, infections, and 
      gastrointestinal health. Dapagliflozin (mean dosage 6.9 ± 5.2 mg once daily) was 
      well-tolerated in children with chronic kidney disease and heart failure. Side 
      effects were generally mild, the most frequent being hypoglycaemia in children 
      with GSD Ib (33% of patients) or T2DM (14% of patients) on concomitant 
      hypoglycaemic drugs. Diabetic ketoacidosis is rare in children. CONCLUSION: Early 
      evidence suggests that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are well tolerated in 
      children. A clinical pharmacology rationale currently exists only for adolescents 
      with diabetes mellitus. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42023438162.

      2 and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Combination for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 78-85
LID - 10.1177/1060028017731111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and 
      place in therapy of the fixed-dose combination (FDC) product, QTERN 
      (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1946 to 
      July 1, 2017) were conducted using the keywords QTERN, saxagliptin, and 
      dapagliflozin. Additional data were obtained from the prescribing information, 
      the product dossier, and Clinicaltrials.gov . STUDY SELECTION AND DATA 
      EXTRACTION: All English language articles related to pharmacology, 
      pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of the combination therapy in human 
      subjects were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin were not affected significantly when administered as an FDC 
      product. Saxagliptin may suppress the increased secretion of glucagon associated 
      with dapagliflozin. The combination dapagliflozin/saxagliptin has been studied as 
      add-on therapy to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM). The difference in hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C) between saxagliptin + 
      dapagliflozin + metformin (triple therapy) and saxagliptin + metformin was -0.59 
      (95% CI = -0.81 to -0.37, P < 0.0001), and the difference between triple therapy 
      and dapagliflozin + metformin was -0.27 (95% CI = -0.48 to -0.05, P = 0.0166). 
      The combination was well tolerated when added to metformin. CONCLUSION: QTERN 
      (dapagliflozin/saxagliptin) tablets are a reasonable option for patients with 
      T2DM not controlled on metformin, but cost, insurance coverage, and a lackluster 
      reduction in A1C will likely limit its use until more data regarding its effects 
      on complications of diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes become available.

      potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type II inhibitor, in animals and humans.
PG  - 405-14

AB  - (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-(3-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-4-chlorophenyl)-6-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol 
      (dapagliflozin; BMS-512148) is a potent sodium-glucose cotransporter type II 
      inhibitor in animals and humans and is currently under development for the 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. The preclinical characterization of dapagliflozin, 
      to allow compound selection and prediction of pharmacological and dispositional 
      behavior in the clinic, involved Caco-2 cell permeability studies, cytochrome 
      P450 (P450) inhibition and induction studies, P450 reaction phenotyping, 
      metabolite identification in hepatocytes, and pharmacokinetics in rats, dogs, and 
      monkeys. Dapagliflozin was found to have good permeability across Caco-2 cell 
      membranes. It was found to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not a 
      significant P-gp inhibitor. Dapagliflozin was not found to be an inhibitor or an 
      inducer of human P450 enzymes. The in vitro metabolic profiles of dapagliflozin 
      after incubation with hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were 
      qualitatively similar. Rat hepatocyte incubations showed the highest turnover, 
      and dapagliflozin was most stable in human hepatocytes. Prominent in vitro 
      metabolic pathways observed were glucuronidation, hydroxylation, and 
      O-deethylation. Pharmacokinetic parameters for dapagliflozin in preclinical 
      species revealed a compound with adequate oral exposure, clearance, and 
      elimination half-life, consistent with the potential for single daily dosing in 
      humans. The pharmacokinetics in humans after a single dose of 50 mg of 
      [(14)C]dapagliflozin showed good exposure, low clearance, adequate half-life, and 
      no metabolites with significant pharmacological activity or toxicological 
      concern.

TI  - Influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of 
      dapagliflozin: an open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study.
PG  - 1798-808
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.09.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of renal sodium glucose 
      co-transporter 2, is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Dapagliflozin elimination is primarily via glucuronidation to an 
      inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Pharmacokinetic studies are 
      recommended in subjects with impaired hepatic function if hepatic metabolism 
      accounts for a substantial portion of the absorbed drug. OBJECTIVE: The purpose 
      of our study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in patients 
      with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (HI) with healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: This was an open-label, parallel-group study in male or female patients 
      with mild, moderate, or severe HI (6 per group according to Child-Pugh 
      classification) and in 6 healthy control subjects. The control subjects were 
      matched to the combined HI group for age (±10 years), weight (±20%), sex, and 
      smoking status, with no deviations from normal in medical history, physical 
      examination, ECG, or laboratory determinations. All participants received a 
      single 10-mg oral dose of dapagliflozin, and the pharmacokinetics of 
      dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide were characterized. Dapagliflozin 
      tolerability was also assessed throughout the study. RESULTS: Demographic 
      characteristics and baseline physical measurements (weight, height, and body mass 
      index) were similar among the 18 patients in the HI groups (58-126 kg; 
      151.2-190.0 cm, and 31.5-37.7 kg/m(2), respectively) and the healthy subject 
      group (65.0-102.6 kg; 166.0-184.0 cm, and 23.3-34.3 kg/m(2), respectively). In 
      those with mild, moderate, or severe HI, dapagliflozin mean C(max) values were 
      12% lower and 12% and 40% higher than healthy subjects, respectively. Mean 
      dapagliflozin AUC(0-∞) values were 3%, 36%, and 67% higher compared with healthy 
      subjects, respectively. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide mean C(max) values were 4% 
      and 58% higher and 14% lower in those with mild, moderate, or severe HI compared 
      with healthy subjects, respectively, and mean dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide 
      AUC(0-∞) values were 6%, 100%, and 30% higher compared with healthy subjects, 
      respectively. These values were highly dependent on the calculated creatinine 
      clearance of each group. All adverse events were mild or moderate, with no 
      imbalance in frequency between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy 
      subjects, systemic exposure to dapagliflozin in subjects with HI was correlated 
      with the degree of HI. Single 10-mg doses of dapagliflozin were generally well 
      tolerated by participants in this study. Due to the higher dapagliflozin 
      exposures in patients with severe HI, the benefit:risk ratio should be 
      individually assessed because the long-term safety profile and efficacy of 
      dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population.

TI  - Development and optimization of sitagliptin and dapagliflozin loaded oral 
      self-nanoemulsifying formulation against type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Control of hyperglycemia and prevention of glucose reabsorption (glucotoxicity) 
      are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. This study deals 
      with an oral combined dosage form design for two anti-diabetic drugs, sitagliptin 
      and dapagliflozin using self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). The 
      SNEDDS were developed using naturally obtained bioactive medium-chain/long-chain 
      triglycerides oil, mixed glycerides and nonionic surfactants, and droplet size 
      was measured followed by the test for antioxidant activities. Equilibrium 
      solubility and dynamic dispersion experiments were conducted to achieve the 
      maximum drug loading. The in vitro digestion, in vivo bioavailability, and 
      anti-diabetic effects were studied to compare the representative SNEDDS with 
      marketed product Dapazin(®). The representative SNEDDS containing black seed oil 
      showed excellent self-emulsification performance with transparent appearance. 
      Characterization of the SNEDDS showed nanodroplets of around 50-66.57 nm in size 
      (confirmed by TEM analysis), in addition to the high drug loading capacity 
      without causing any precipitation in the gastro-intestinal tract. The SNEDDS 
      provided higher antioxidant activity compared to the pure drugs. The in vivo 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of SNEDDS showed significant increase in C (max) 
      (1.99 ± 0.21 µg mL(-1)), AUC (17.94 ± 1.25 µg mL(-1)), and oral absorption 
      (2-fold) of dapagliflozin compared to the commercial product in the rat model. 
      The anti-diabetic studies showed the significant inhibition of glucose level in 
      treated diabetic mice by SNEDDS combined dose compared to the single drug 
      therapy. The combined dose of sitagliptin-dapagliflozin using SNEDDS could be a 
      potential oral pharmaceutical product for the improved treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
      characteristics, and tolerability of janagliflozin, a novel sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in Chinese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 36 people with T2DM were randomly 
      assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive janagliflozin 25 mg, janagliflozin 50 mg, 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Participants received a single dose on day 1, and 
      were treated once daily from day 4 to day 17. RESULTS: Following oral 
      administration, janagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching C(max) at 2 hours. 
      The mean half-life (t(1/2) ) at steady state was approximately 21 to 23 hours. 
      There was no significant accumulation with multiple doses (accumulation 
      factor < 2). In participants treated with janagliflozin 25 mg, janagliflozin 
      50 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, change in mean 24-hour urinary glucose 
      excretion from baseline was 92.35, 94.17, 87.61 and 6.26 g after multiple doses, 
      and change in mean fasting plasma glucose level from baseline to day 17 was 
      -2.18, -2.66, -2.79 and 1.70%, respectively. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild 
      or moderate with no deaths, serious AEs, or discontinuations due to AEs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Single and multiple oral administration (14 days) of janagliflozin 
      25 mg and 50 mg exhibited favourable PK, PD and tolerability profiles in Chinese 
      people with T2DM, which were comparable to those of dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
      Janagliflozin 25 mg and 50 mg are recommended for further clinical investigation.

AB  - PURPOSE: Coadministration of lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin is expected to 
      result in a blood glucose-lowering effect, followed by a gradual increase, in 
      clinical usage; however, combining drugs could cause negative interactions. This 
      study aimed to evaluate the effect of the coadministration of lobeglitazone and 
      dapagliflozin on their individual pharmacokinetic properties at steady state in 
      healthy male volunteers in the fasted state. METHODS: This study consisted of 2 
      parts, each of which was a randomized, open-labeled, multiple-dose, 2-way 
      crossover study in 20 healthy male volunteers in each part. Blood samples were 
      taken periodically over a 48-h period after dosing to derive total plasma 
      lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin pharmacokinetic properties; safety profile was 
      evaluated throughout the study. FINDINGS: When the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      dapagliflozin were evaluated following its administration alone and in 
      combination with lobeglitazone, point estimate and 90% CI of the geometric mean 
      ratio of dapagliflozin AUC(τ) were entirely within the conventional 
      bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. However, although it was not clinically 
      meaningful, its C(ss,max) was ~8% lower in subjects receiving multiple doses of 
      dapagliflozin and lobeglitazone than that in those administered dapagliflozin 
      alone. The pharmacokinetic properties of lobeglitazone were evaluated following 
      its administration alone and in combination with dapagliflozin. The geometric 
      mean ratios and 90% CIs of the lobeglitazone C(ss,max) and AUC(τ) were within the 
      conventional bioequivalence range of 80%-125%. IMPLICATIONS: Coadministration of 
      lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin had no apparent clinically relevant effects on 
      the pharmacokinetic properties of either drug. Based on these findings, it is 
      anticipated that lobeglitazone and dapagliflozin can be coadministered without 
      dose adjustment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03616392.

      inhibitor, in diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 142

AB  - Although antidiabetic agents have been developed to target one or more of the 
      core defects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), many patients do not achieve 
      glycemic goals. Inhibition of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) induces 
      glycosuria, reduces glucose toxicity and improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell 
      function. As the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is different from other 
      agents and completely insulin-independent, the use of these drugs might 
      potentially be efficacious alone or in combination with any other antidiabetic 
      drug, including insulin. Dapagliflozin is a highly selective and reversible SGLT2 
      inhibitor approved for use in adult patients with T2DM as monotherapy in patients 
      intolerant of metformin or as adjunctive therapy in patients inadequately 
      controlled on existing antidiabetic medications, including insulin. A literature 
      search conducted using PubMed identified key publications related to the use of 
      dapagliflozin in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. No date limits 
      were applied. This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of this SGLT2 
      inhibitor. Dapagliflozin produces dose-related reductions in glycosylated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) as monotherapy and as add-on to other antidiabetic agents, 
      with significant reductions in body weight. Hypoglycemia is uncommon. Preliminary 
      data from a phase 2 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study suggest that 
      dapagliflozin may also improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes 
      mellitus. Clinical trials published to date show that dapagliflozin is safe and 
      effective as monotherapy or as an add-on to insulin or oral antidiabetic agents 
      in patients with T2DM.

TI  - Exposure-Response Analysis of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors 
      Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin on Kidney Hemodynamics in Patients with Type 2 
      Diabetes.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve markers for renal and 
      cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). To 
      assess whether individual differences in plasma drug exposure can explain 
      inter-individual response variation, we characterized the exposure-response 
      relationship for two SGLT2 inhibitors on several clinical and kidney hemodynamic 
      variables. Data were obtained from two studies, RED and RECOLAR, assessing the 
      effects of once-daily 10 mg dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, respectively, on 
      kidney hemodynamics in patients with T2D. Individual plasma exposure was 
      estimated using non-compartmental analyses and exposure-response relationships 
      were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. In 23 patients participating in 
      RED, the dapagliflozin geometric mean apparent area under the concentration-time 
      curve during one dosing interval at steady state (AUC(0-tau,ss)) was 1153.1 
      µg/L*h (coefficient of variation (CV) 81.8%) and associated, per doubling, with 
      decreases in body weight (0.29 kg, p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (0.80 
      mmHg, p = 0.002), measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) (0.83 mL/min, p = 
      0.03), and filtration fraction (0.09%, p = 0.04). In 20 patients participating in 
      RECOLOR, the empagliflozin geometric mean AUC(0-tau,ss) was 2035.7 nmol/L*h (CV 
      48.4%) and associated, per doubling, with decreases in body weight (0.13 kg, p = 
      0.002), systolic blood pressure (0.65 mmHg, p = 0.045), and mGFR (0.78 mL/min, p 
      = 0.002). To conclude, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin plasma exposure was highly 
      variable between patients and associated with inter-individual variation in 
      response variables.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor 
      that reduces blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by 
      promoting glycosuria via inhibiting urinary glucose reabsorption. In addition to 
      improving blood glucose control, treatment with dapagliflozin results in 
      glucose-induced osmotic diuresis, weight loss, and blood pressure lowering. 
      Previous trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors showed reductions in cardiovascular (CV) 
      events, including CV death and hospitalization for heart failure, and ischemic 
      events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: DECLARE-TIMI 58 (NCT01730534) is a phase 3b randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the CV safety and 
      efficacy of dapagliflozin that has completed randomization of 17,160 patients 
      with T2DM and a history of either established ASCVD (n=6,971) or multiple risk 
      factors for ASCVD (n=10,189). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo. The primary safety outcome is the time 
      to the first event of the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or 
      ischemic stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events; MACEs). The co-primary 
      efficacy outcomes are the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or 
      ischemic stroke and the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart 
      failure. This event-driven trial will continue until at least 1,390 subjects have 
      a MACE outcome, thereby providing >99% power to test for the primary outcome of 
      safety of dapagliflozin measured by rejecting the hypothesis that the upper bound 
      of the CI >1.3 for the primary outcome of MACE, as well as 85% power to detect a 
      15% relative risk reduction in MACE and an estimated 87% power to detect a 20% 
      reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure at a 
      1-sided α level of .0231. CONCLUSION: The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial is testing the 
      hypotheses that dapagliflozin is safe (does not increase) and may reduce the 
      occurrence of major CV events. DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest study to address 
      this question with an SGLT-2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and with established 
      CV disease and without CV disease but with multiple risk factors.

TI  - Dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 590-8
LID - 10.1345/aph.1Q538 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature and describe the pharmacologic, 
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties; clinical safety; and efficacy of 
      dapagliflozin, a new drug currently under review by the Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: A 
      MEDLINE (1995-November 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using 
      the terms dapagliflozin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and SGLT2 
      inhibitor. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed. 
      STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language studies, including 
      abstracts, evaluating dapagliflozin use in humans were included in this review. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Dapagliflozin is the first-in-class oral sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that represents a new potential therapeutic 
      option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its mechanism of action is 
      insulin- and insulin-sensitivity independent. Preliminary data suggest that 
      dapagliflozin decreases hemoglobin A(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and 
      postprandial plasma glucose, while also promoting weight loss. In Phase 1, 2, and 
      3 clinical trials, dapagliflozin has exhibited a safety and tolerability profile 
      similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin is a novel oral 
      antihyperglycemic agent that has demonstrated promise as monotherapy and as 
      synergistic combination therapy with currently available agents in Phase 3 
      clinical trials. On January 19, 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter 
      to AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the new drug application for 
      dapagliflozin. The FDA is requesting additional clinical data-from ongoing 
      studies and potentially new clinical trials-to better describe the risk-benefit 
      profile of the drug. Both manufacturers remain committed to the development of 
      dapagliflozin, and there are currently 8 Phase 3 trials ongoing. Dapagliflozin 
      has the potential to be the next new oral agent in the diabetes drug 
      armamentarium.

AB  - Physical storage of formulations may result in physical composition changes that 
      affect pharmacokinetics. Dapagliflozin, an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
      inhibitor used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, stored under prolonged exposure to 
      heat converts crystalline dapagliflozin to an amorphous form. Bioequivalence of 
      the amorphous to crystalline form and food effects of each form in the 2.5-mg 
      formulation are unknown. Two open-label, crossover, single-dose studies in 
      healthy participants assessed pharmacokinetics for heat-stressed (HS) and 
      non-heat-stressed (NH) dapagliflozin 10-mg (study 1, N=29, fasted+HS food effect) 
      and 2.5-mg (study 2, N=28, fasted+HS and NH food effect) tablets. The 90% 
      confidence intervals for geometric mean ratios of area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) for HS 2.5- and 
      10-mg tablets were within 80-125%, indicating bioequivalence. In the fed vs. 
      fasted state for 2.5-mg and 10-mg HS tablets, AUCs were similar, time to Cmax was 
      prolonged by 1.25h, and Cmax decreased by approximately 50%. No serious adverse 
      events were reported. Given that dapagliflozin's efficacy is dependent upon AUC, 
      it was concluded that HS and NH dapagliflozin tablets are bioequivalent in 2.5- 
      and 10-mg doses with no clinically meaningful food effect for either form.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the availability of many antihypreglycemic agents, many 
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) fail to achieve the glycemic treatment goal, 
      primarily due to progressive beta-cell dysfunction, and increased risk of 
      hypoglycemia. AREAS COVERED: The aim of the present article is to review the 
      efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin , a novel antihyperglycemic drug that lowers 
      the plasma glucose concentration by the inhibition of renal sodium-glucose 
      cotransport, in lowering the plasma glucose concentration and the HbA1c in T2DM 
      patents. This review summarizes the published data about the mechanism of action 
      and clinical efficacy of dapagliflozin in lowering the HbA1c in patients with 
      T2DM. It also discusses additional non-glycemic benefits of dapagliflozin and the 
      safety profile of the drug. EXPERT OPINION: Dapagliflozin is effective in 
      lowering the plasma glucose concentration in patients with T2DM with a good 
      safety profile. Because of its unique mechanism of action, dapagliflozin can be 
      utilized in combination with all other antihyperglycemic agents and at all stages 
      of the disease.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors in 
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 691-708
LID - 10.1007/s40262-015-0264-4 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 
      cotransporters are responsible for reabsorption of 90 % of the glucose filtered 
      by the kidney. The glucuretic effect resulting from SGLT2 inhibition contributes 
      to reduce hyperglycaemia and also assists weight loss and blood pressure 
      reduction. Several SGLT2 inhibitors are already available in many countries 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) and in Japan (ipragliflozin, 
      tofogliflozin). These SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life 
      allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via 
      glucuronidation to inactive metabolites and a low renal elimination as a parent 
      drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters are slightly altered in the case of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). While no dose adjustment is required in the case of mild 
      CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors may not be used or only at a lower daily dose in patients 
      with moderate CKD. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors 
      as assessed by urinary glucose excretion declines with increasing severity of 
      renal impairment as assessed by a reduction in the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate. Nevertheless, the glucose-lowering efficacy and safety of SGLT2 
      inhibitors are almost comparable in patients with mild CKD as in patients with 
      normal kidney function. In patients with moderate CKD, the efficacy tends to be 
      dampened and safety concerns may occur. In patients with severe CKD, the use of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors is contraindicated. Thus, prescribing information should be 
      consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in the case of renal 
      dysfunction for each SGLT2 inhibitor. The clinical impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on 
      renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic 
      nephropathy deserve attention because of preliminary favourable results in animal 
      models.

TI  - Dapagliflozin: a review of its use in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2191-209
LID - 10.1007/s40265-014-0324-3 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin (Forxiga(®), Farxiga(®)) is an orally administered sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used in the management of patients with type 2 
      diabetes. Dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption by inhibiting the 
      transporter protein SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule, thereby increasing 
      urinary glucose excretion and reducing blood glucose levels. Its mechanism of 
      action is independent of insulin secretion or action; therefore, dapagliflozin 
      provides complementary therapy when used in combination with other 
      antihyperglycaemic drugs. This article updates an earlier review of dapagliflozin 
      and focuses on longer-term efficacy and tolerability data (e.g. from extensions 
      of earlier clinical trials), as well as data from studies in special patient 
      populations (e.g. history of cardiovascular disease). Numerous well-designed 
      clinical trials with dapagliflozin, primarily as add-on therapy for 24 weeks (but 
      also as monotherapy or initial combination therapy), have consistently 
      demonstrated reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose 
      levels and bodyweight. Extensions of these trials show the effects are maintained 
      over longer-term follow-up periods of ≈1-4 years and dapagliflozin is generally 
      well tolerated. Dapagliflozin has a low risk of hypoglycaemia, although the 
      incidence varies depending on background therapy, and genital mycotic infections 
      (particularly in women) are the most common adverse events. Dapagliflozin is not 
      recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In view of its 
      unique mechanism of action and now well-established efficacy and tolerability 
      profile, dapagliflozin is a useful treatment option in the management of type 2 
      diabetes, although its effects on diabetic complications remain to be evaluated.

AB  - Evogliptin (EV) is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) for glycemic 
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study evaluated 
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions between EV and 
      sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in healthy volunteers since 
      combination therapy of DPP4i and SGLT2i has been considered as an effective 
      option for T2DM treatment. A randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-arm, 
      three-period, three treatments, two-sequence crossover study was conducted in 
      healthy Korean volunteers. In arm 1, subjects were administered 5 mg of EV once 
      daily for 7 days, 25 mg of empagliflozin (EP) once daily for 5 days, and the 
      combination once daily for 5 days (EV + EP). In arm 2, subjects were administered 
      5 mg of EV once daily for 7 days, 10 mg of dapagliflozin (DP) once daily for 
      5 days, and the combination once daily for 5 days (EV + DP). Serial blood samples 
      were collected for PK analysis, and oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted 
      for PD analysis. In each arm, a total of 18 subjects completed the study. All 
      adverse events (AEs) were mild with no serious AEs. The geometric mean ratio and 
      confidence interval of the main PK parameters (maximum concentration of the drug 
      in plasma at steady state and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve 
      within a dosing interval at a steady state) between EV and either EP or DP alone 
      were not significantly altered by co-administration. Administration of EV + EP or 
      EV + DP did not result in significant PD changes, as determined by the 
      glucose-lowering effect. Administration of EV + EP or EV + DP had no significant 
      effects on the PK profiles of each drug. All treatments were well-tolerated.

AB  - A single LC-MS/MS assay has been developed and validated for the simultaneous 
      determination of metformin and dapagliflozin in human plasma using ion-pair 
      solid-phase extraction. Chromatographic separation of the analytes and their 
      internal standards was carried out on a reversed-phase ACE 5CN (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 
      μm) column using acetonitrile-15 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5 (70:30, v/v) as the 
      mobile phase. To achieve higher sensitivity and selectivity for the analytes, 
      mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a polarity switching approach. 
      Ion transitions studied using multiple reaction monitoring mode were m/z 130.1 
      [M + H](+) /60.1 for metformin and m/z 467.1 [M + CH(3) COO](-) /329.1 for 
      dapagliflozin in the positive and negative modes, respectively. The linear 
      calibration range of the assay was established from 1.00 to 2000 ng/mL for 
      metformin and from 0.10 to 200 ng/mL for dapagliflozin to achieve a better 
      assessment of the pharmacokinetics of the drugs. The limit of detection and limit 
      of quantitation for the analytes were 0.39 and 1.0 ng/mL for metformin and 0.03 
      and 0.1 ng/mL for dapagliflozin, respectively. There was no interference of 
      plasma matrix obtained from different sources, including hemolyzed and lipemic 
      plasma. The method was successfully applied to study the effect of food on the 
      pharmacokinetics of metformin and dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.

AB  - Diabetes and its complications account for a significant healthcare burden. There 
      is increasing prevalence of diabetes and newer drugs are being investigated to 
      improve outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) are 
      a newer class of medications, which prevent renal reabsorption of glucose and 
      hence help in glycaemic control without significant risk of hypoglycaemia. Two 
      drugs, namely dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have gained approval and 
      empagliflozin is one of the advanced agents of this class. Early trials with 
      empagliflozin have shown a stable pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic 
      effects with significant SGLT2 selectivity. Clinical trials have shown 
      improvement in glycaemic control and other benefits including weight loss and 
      lowering of blood pressure. Ongoing trials and surveillance will provide answers 
      about cardiovascular benefits, risk of osteoporosis and cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and 
      adverse effects of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitor. DATA SOURCES: Data were gathered from articles indexed in PubMed, 
      International Pharmaceutical from (2006 to April 2014) was performed using the 
      following terms "dapagliflozin," "SGLT-2 inhibitor," and "Farxiga." Abstracts and 
      manufacturer's package insert were also used as an additional reference. STUDY 
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English language prospective randomized, 
      double-blinded trials evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin for the treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes were identified. DATA SYNTHESIS: We evaluated 9 clinical 
      trials with dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy. Results from these 
      studies demonstrated that dapagliflozin to be noninferior to metformin in 
      treatment naïve patients for reduction in A1C. Additionally, dapagliflozin was 
      noninferior to glimepiride when added on to metformin. As an add-on therapy to 
      insulin, insulin sensitizers or sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was found to be 
      clinically effective compared to placebo. Finally, in all of the clinical trials 
      increased risk of urinary infection was common in dapagliflozin group. 
      CONCLUSION: As the second SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in the United States, 
      dapagliflozin is safe and effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It 
      appears to have no increased cardiovascular risk and provides a moderate benefit 
      for patients with high blood pressure or those who are overweight. However, 
      dapagliflozin was found to be associated with nasopharyngitis, mycotic 
      infections, and genital or urinary tract infections. This medication may be best 
      used as adjunctive therapy for patients not well-controlled on other antidiabetic 
      agents. However, caution should be taken when used in patients at risk of urinary 
      tract infections and dehydration.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) agent sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors show special benefits in reducing body weight and heart failure risks. 
      To accelerate clinical development for novel SGLT2 inhibitors, a quantitative 
      relationship among pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and disease end points 
      (PK/PD/end points) in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM was developed. 
      PK/PD/end point data in published clinical studies for three globally marketed 
      SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) were collected 
      according to pre-set criteria. Overall, 80 papers with 880 PK, 27 PD, 848 fasting 
      plasma glucose (FPG), and 1219 hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) data were collected. A 
      two-compartmental model with Hill's equation was utilized to capture PK/PD 
      profiles. A novel translational biomarker, the change of urine glucose excretion 
      (UGE) from baseline normalized by FPG (ΔUGE(c) ) was identified to bridge healthy 
      subjects and patients with T2DM with different disease statuses. ΔUGE(c) was 
      found to have a similar maximum increase with different half-maximal effective 
      concentration values of 56.6, 2310, and 841 mg/mL·h for dapagliflozin, 
      canagliflozin, and empagliflozin respectively. ΔUGE(c) will change FPG based on 
      linear function. HbA1c profiles were captured by indirect response model. 
      Additional placebo effect was also considered for both end points. The PK/ΔUGE(c) 
      /FPG/HbA1c relationship was validated internally using diagnostic plots and 
      visual assessment and further validated externally using the fourth globally 
      approved same-in-class drug (ertugliflozin). This validated quantitative 
      PK/PD/end point relationship offers novel insight into long-term efficacy 
      prediction for SGLT2 inhibitors. The novelty identified ΔUGE(c) could make the 
      comparison of different SGLT2 inhibitors' efficacy characteristics easier, and 
      achieve early prediction from healthy subjects to patients.

      Extended-release Fixed-combination Drug Products Compared With Coadministration

AB  - PURPOSE: Fixed-combination drug products (FCDPs) for patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may show efficacy comparable to their individual 
      components (ICs) while improving adherence to treatment. This study evaluated the 
      bioequivalence and safety of 2 dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin 
      extended-release (XR) FCDPs relative to their ICs: saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, single-dose, 
      single-center crossover study was conducted in 84 healthy subjects aged 18-55 
      years. The primary objective was to evaluate the fed-state bioequivalence of a 
      dapagliflozin 5-mg/saxagliptin 2.5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP and a 
      dapagliflozin 10-mg/saxagliptin 5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP relative to the 
      ICs. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the effect of food on the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of saxagliptin, dapagliflozin, and metformin in 
      both FCDPs and characterization of the PK parameters of the active metabolite of 
      saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, in healthy subjects. PK parameters (AUC(0-∞), 
      AUC(0-t), and C(max)) were used to assess the bioequivalence of the 2 FCDPs with 
      their ICs. The C(max) and AUC(0-t) of the study drugs were compared between 
      female and male subjects to assess sex differences in exposure. Safety and 
      tolerability of both FCDPs and ICs were also assessed with adverse events, vital 
      signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate), 12-lead ECG, 
      physical examinations, and laboratory assessments. FINDINGS: Both 
      dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin XR FCDPs were bioequivalent to their ICs. For 
      the dapagliflozin 5-mg/saxagliptin 2.5-mg/metformin 1000-mg XR FCDP, the 90% CI 
      for the geometric mean ratio of dapagliflozin C(max) was slightly above the 
      80%-125% bioequivalence limit, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Food 
      delayed the absorption of the study drugs in both FCDPs, which is unlikely to 
      have a clinically relevant impact on efficacy. In both cohorts, exposure was 
      higher in female subjects compared with male subjects, potentially due to the 
      lower body weight of the female subjects. The safety profile and tolerability of 
      the FCDPs were similar to those of their ICs, and no deaths or serious adverse 
      events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: These data support the use of the 
      dapagliflozin/saxagliptin/metformin XR FCDP in patients with T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin, a selective, orally active, renal sodium glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 2 inhibitor, is under investigation as a treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin reduces hyperglycemia by 
      inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption and dose-dependently increasing urinary 
      glucose excretion, independent of insulin secretion or action. OBJECTIVES: These 
      studies assessed the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmaco 
      dynamic properties of dapagliflozin and its major inactive metabolite, 
      dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), in healthy subjects residing in China. 
      METHODS: In 2 identically designed, open-label, single- and multiple-dose studies 
      (n = 14 for both studies), healthy Chinese subjects were administered oral 
      dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg. In both studies, subjects received a single dose on day 
      1 (single-dose administration period) followed by 6 once-daily doses on days 5 to 
      10 (multiple-dose administration period). Pharmacokinetic parameters (plasma and 
      urinary dapagliflozin and D3OG), pharmacodynamic response (urinary glucose 
      excretion), and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed 
      the dapagliflozin 5-mg study, and 13 completed the dapagliflozin 10-mg study. 
      Baseline characteristics were balanced across the two studies: 9 versus 10 men; 
      mean age, 27.1 versus 28.9 years; mean weight, 62.8 versus 62.2 kg; and mean body 
      mass index, 23.0 versus 22.2 kg/m(2) in the dapagliflozin 5- and 10-mg studies, 
      respectively. In both doses, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed (T(max), ≤1.5 h), 
      accumulation (defined as the geometric mean ratio of AUC(τ) at day 10 to AUC(τ) 
      at day 1) after multiple dosing was minimal (<1.13 fold), and elimination 
      half-life was 10 to 12 h. D3OG showed a slightly longer median Tmax (≤2 h) but a 
      similar plasma concentration-time profile and half-life compared with 
      dapagliflozin. The majority of D3OG (up to 69.7% of the dapagliflozin dose) was 
      excreted in urine, while ≤1.9% of dapagliflozin was excreted unchanged in urine. 
      Over a 24-hour period and at steady state (day 10), urinary glucose excretion 
      values were 28.1 and 41.1 g with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively. 
      Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated; one dapagliflozin 10 mg-treated 
      subject discontinued the study because of a serious adverse event (bronchitis) 
      considered by the investigator as unrelated to dapagliflozin dosing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics following single- and 
      multiple-dose dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg oral administration in healthy Chinese 
      subjects were as predicted from previous studies and were similar to findings 
      observed in non-Chinese healthy subjects. Dapagliflozin dosing was well 
      tolerated. The clinically recommended dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg once daily is 
      expected to be appropriate in patients of Chinese ethnicity; results from an 
      efficacy and tolerability study in Chinese patients with T2DM are awaited.

      randomized, double-blind, crossover study.
PG  - 188-97

AB  - AIMS: To compare the pharmacodynamic effects of the highest approved doses of the 
      sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors canagliflozin and 
      dapagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion (UGE), renal threshold for glucose 
      excretion (RTG ) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) excursion in healthy 
      participants in a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover study. METHODS: 
      In each treatment period, participants (n = 54) received canagliflozin 300 mg or 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg for 4 days (20 min before breakfast). A mixed-meal tolerance 
      test (600 kcal; 75 g glucose) was performed at baseline and on day 4 of each 
      treatment period to assess changes in incremental PPG (PPGΔAUC0-2 h ). We 
      measured 24-h UGE and plasma glucose on day 4 to determine 24-h mean RTG . 
      RESULTS: Canagliflozin 300 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg had similar effects on UGE 
      and RTG for 4 h after dosing, but canagliflozin was associated with higher UGE 
      and greater RTG reductions for the remainder of the day. Mean 24-h UGE was ∼25% 
      higher with canagliflozin than with dapagliflozin (51.4 vs. 40.8 g), and 24-h 
      mean RTG was ∼0.4 mmol/l (7 mg/dl) lower with canagliflozin than with 
      dapagliflozin (3.79 vs. 4.17 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). Dapagliflozin had no effect on 
      PPG excursion; canagliflozin delayed and reduced PPG excursion (between-treatment 
      difference in PPGΔAUC0-2 h from baseline expressed as a percentage of baseline 
      mean, -10.2%; p = 0.0122). Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin were generally well 
      tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy participants, canagliflozin 300 mg provided 
      greater 24-h UGE, a lower RTG and smaller PPG excursions than dapagliflozin 
      10 mg.

      markers.

AB  - The mechanisms by which SGLT-2 inhibitors lower albuminuria are incompletely 
      understood. We assessed in a post-hoc analysis of a cross-over trial the effects 
      of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on glomerular markers (IgG to IgG4 and IgG 
      to albumin), tubular markers (urinary KIM-1, NGAL and LFABP) and inflammatory 
      markers (urinary MCP-1 and IL-6) to provide more insight into kidney protective 
      effects. Dapagliflozin decreased albuminuria by 43.9% (95% CI, 30.3%-54.8%) and 
      eGFR by 5.1 (2.0-8.1) mL/min/1.73m(2) compared to placebo. Dapagliflozin did not 
      change glomerular charge or size selectivity index compared to placebo. 
      Dapagliflozin decreased urinary KIM-1 excretion by 22.6% (0.3%-39.8%; P = .05) 
      and IL-6 excretion by 23.5% (1.4%-40.6%; P = .04) compared to placebo, whereas no 
      changes in NGAL, LFABP and MCP-1 were observed. During dapagliflozin treatment, 
      changes in albuminuria correlated with changes in eGFR (r = 0.36; P = .05) and 
      KIM-1 (r = 0.39; P = .05). In conclusion, the albuminuria-lowering effect of 6 
      weeks of dapagliflozin therapy may be the result of decreased intraglomerular 
      pressure or reduced tubular cell injury.

TI  - Effects of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on 6-min walk distance in heart 
      failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction: A systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving 2624 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s00228-024-03660-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are antidiabetic medications. They 
      are the first two sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) to receive 
      the US Food and Drug Administration approval to manage heart failure. Emerging 
      new trials have examined changes in the 6-min walk distance as a clinically 
      significant response to dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with heart 
      failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with preserved 
      ejection fraction (HFrEF). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on the 6-min walk distance in patients with HFpEF 
      and HFrEF. To our knowledge, no such meta-analysis has been published. METHODS: 
      Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we searched four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, 
      Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) to identify eligible studies reported up to 
      December 16, 2023. Using Review Manager software, we reported outcomes as risk 
      ratios (RRs) or mean difference (MD) and confidence intervals (CIs). A 
      p-value ≤ 0.05 is considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The 
      meta-analysis included a total of 8 studies with 2624 patients. Overall, the 
      results showed insignificant differences in the 6-min walk between the SGLT2i and 
      placebo (MD 24, 95% CI -0.30 to 18.78, p = 0.06). Results became significant 
      after resolving the heterogeneity (MD 6.72, 95% CI 0.13 to 13.31, p = 0.05). 
      Notably, the results of each drug separately were insignificant. More robust 
      observations occurred in the HFpEF group (MD 10.73, 95% CI 1.08 to 20.39, 
      p = 0.03). Compared to placebo, patients on dapagliflozin reported significant 
      improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary 
      (KCCQ-CS) and Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) with values of MD 5.18 (95% CI 2.80 to 
      7.57, p < 0.0001) and MD 4.06 (95% CI 1.66 to 6.46, p = 0.0009), respectively. 
      The dapagliflozin group and patients with HFpEF had reported a significant 
      reduction in their weight compared with the control group (MD -0.59 CI -1.09 to 
      -0.08, p = 0.02) and (MD -0.80 CI -1.47 to -0.13, p = 0.02), respectively. No 
      significant side effects were observed for dapagliflozin or empagliflozin. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with HFpEF experienced benefits from SGLT2i administration, 
      as evidenced by improved 6-min walk distances and weight reduction. Dapagliflozin 
      demonstrated clinical and overall improvements in KCCQ scores and was more 
      effective in reducing weight than the placebo. Both Dapagliflozin and 
      Empagliflozin were well-tolerated and exhibited favorable safety profiles. Future 
      studies could benefit from a larger patient population, a longer follow-up 
      period, and a broader range of SGLT2i.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 -inhibitors (SGLT2i) are oral glucose-lowering 
      drugs that have also demonstrated cardioprotective and renoprotective effects. 
      SGLT2i play an increasingly important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
      Here we report a simple and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of three SGLT2i 
      (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in human plasma, serum and urine 
      with a runtime of 1 min. Methanol was used as protein precipitating agent. 
      Chromatographic separation was accomplished using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 
      1.8 μm; 2.1 × 50 mm column with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm VanGuard 
      Pre-column; 2.1 × 5 mm, using gradient elution with ammonium acetate 20 mM (pH 5) 
      and acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Mass spectrometric 
      analysis of the acetate adduct ions was carried out using electrospray with 
      negative ionization and SRM mode. The assay was validated according to FDA and 
      EMA guidelines, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision, 
      dilution integrity, stability and recovery. With a sample volume of 200 µl, 
      linear ranges of 10-5000 µg/L, 1-500 µg/L and 2-1000 µg/L for canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively, were achieved. The assay was 
      successfully applied in two pharmacokinetic studies with dapagliflozin and 
      empagliflozin. In conclusion, we developed and validated a simple, fast and 
      robust LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, that allows rapid analysis of large numbers of 
      samples and can be used for both pharmacokinetic studies and biomedical analysis 
      of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.

TI  - Bioequivalence of Dapagliflozin/Metformin Extended-release Fixed-combination Drug 
      Product and Single-component Dapagliflozin and Metformin Extended-release Tablets 
      in Healthy Russian Subjects.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fixed-combination drug products (FCDPs) combining dapagliflozin and 
      metformin extended release (XR) may provide patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus with an alternative antihyperglycemic treatment, which could improve 
      adherence by reducing tablet burden. This study evaluated the bioequivalence of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR FCDP versus the co-administration of the individual 
      monotherapy tablets currently available for use in the Russian Federation. 
      METHODS: Healthy subjects aged 18 to 45 years were enrolled in this randomized, 
      open-label, 2-period crossover study, conducted in a single Russian center. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-t), C(max), and C(max)/AUC(0-t)) were used to 
      assess bioequivalence of dapagliflozin/metformin XR (10/1000 mg) FCDP to the 
      individual component tablets (dapagliflozin [10 mg] plus metformin XR [2 × 500 
      mg]) under standard fed conditions. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. 
      FINDINGS: Forty healthy subjects were included (47.5% male; mean age, 30 years; 
      and mean body mass index, 24.2 kg/m(2)). Dapagliflozin and metformin XR in the 
      FCDP were bioequivalent to the individual component tablets marketed in the 
      Russian Federation, with the 90% CIs of the geometric least-squares mean ratios 
      for all key pharmacokinetic parameters being contained within the 80% to 125% 
      bioequivalence limits. Both FCDP and the individual component formulations were 
      well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. IMPLICATIONS: Bioequivalence of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR FCDP and the individual components was established 
      without any new safety concerns, presenting a safe alternative for patients 
      currently receiving regimens including each component individually.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interactions between dapagliflozin and simvastatin, 
      valsartan, warfarin, or digoxin.
PG  - 163-77
LID - 10.1007/s12325-011-0098-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease are 
      the most common causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). The aim of these studies was to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor 
      being developed for the treatment of T2DM, and four medications commonly 
      prescribed in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease: simvastatin, 
      valsartan, warfarin, and digoxin. METHODS: Potential pharmacokinetic interactions 
      between 20 mg dapagliflozin, 40 mg simvastatin, or 320 mg valsartan were assessed 
      in an open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover 
      study in 24 healthy subjects. In a second study, the effects of steady-state 
      dapagliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of 25 mg warfarin or 0.25 mg digoxin were 
      assessed in an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment crossover study 
      in 30 healthy subjects divided into two cohorts. The potential pharmacodynamic 
      interaction between dapagliflozin and warfarin was also evaluated. RESULTS: All 
      treatments were well tolerated. Neither simvastatin nor valsartan had any 
      clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin. 
      Dapagliflozin increased the area under the curve for simvastatin, simvastatin 
      acid, and valsartan by approximately 19%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, and 
      decreased the maximum observed plasma concentration of valsartan by approximately 
      6%. These effects were not considered clinically meaningful. In addition, 
      dapagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either digoxin or 
      warfarin. The pharmacodynamics of warfarin were also unaffected by dapagliflozin. 
      CONCLUSION: In these studies the co-administration of dapagliflozin and 
      simvastatin, valsartan, warfarin, or digoxin was well tolerated without 
      clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction.

TI  - Alternate-day add-on therapy with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: potential benefits and concerns.
PG  - 197-203
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2022.2053111 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Factors such as compliance, cost and safety play a major role in 
      achieving the long-term goal in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). Dapagliflozin carries a great potential of becoming an alternate-day 
      therapy because of its favorable pharmacological properties. AREAS COVERED: In 
      this review, we have discussed and hypothesized the potential of dapagliflozin as 
      an alternate-day add-on drug in T2DM patients. We have discussed the properties 
      by virtue of which it carries a potential to become an alternate-day therapy. We 
      have also explained the potential benefits and concerns of using this approach. 
      EXPERT OPINION: Alternate-day add-on therapy with dapagliflozin could be a 
      promising approach in reducing the cost, improving the treatment satisfaction and 
      reducing the adverse effects. However, this propsed indication demands an 
      in-depth investigation among T2DM subjects who are not able to achieve glycemic 
      control with standard monotherapy or combination therapy. Pilot studies or some 
      small-scale investigator-initiated trials or academic clinical trials may be 
      carried out to explore this concept. At the same time, large industry sponsored 
      multicenter clinical trials including pharmacoeconomic analyses may be planned to 
      have a more detailed investigation.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics (PK) of dapagliflozin and metformin administered as 
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets (2.5 mg dapagliflozin/850 mg metformin or 
      5 mg dapagliflozin/1000 mg metformin) or as separate tablets in healthy subjects 
      were evaluated in 2 separate studies. Study 1 evaluated PK by measuring mean 
      ratios of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (time zero to infinity 
      [AUCinf ]), AUC from zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC0-t ), and 
      maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax ) for single-component or FDC tablets 
      following a non-high-fat meal. Mean ratios of AUCinf , AUC0-t , and Cmax for FDC 
      or single-component dapagliflozin and metformin tablets were close to unity. In 
      study 2, AUCinf , AUC0-t , and Cmax for the FDC tablet were obtained fasting and 
      after a high-fat meal. Dapagliflozin 5 mg and metformin 1000 mg geometric mean 
      Cmax was increased in the fasted versus fed state (61.9 vs 43.9 and 1600 vs 
      1330 ng/mL, respectively), but AUC0-t was similar (267 and 265 and 11 000 and 
      10 600 ng · h/mL, respectively). In summary, FDC tablets were bioequivalent to 
      single-component tablets, and total absorption (AUC) was similar for non-high-fat 
      and high-fat meals.

TI  - Development of Dapagliflozin Solid Lipid Nanoparticles as a Novel Carrier for 
      Oral Delivery: Statistical Design, Optimization, In-Vitro and In-Vivo 
      Characterization, and Evaluation.

AB  - Controlling hyperglycemia and avoiding glucose reabsorption are significant goals 
      in type 2 diabetes treatments. Among the numerous modes of medication 
      administration, the oral route is the most common. Introduction: Dapagliflozin is 
      an oral hypoglycemic agent and a powerful, competitive, reversible, highly 
      selective, and orally active human SGLT2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin-loaded solid 
      lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are the focus of our present investigation. 
      Controlled-release lipid nanocarriers were formulated by integrating them into 
      lipid nanocarriers. The nanoparticle size and lipid utilized for formulation help 
      to regulate the release of pharmaceuticals over some time. Dapagliflozin-loaded 
      nanoparticles were formulated by hot homogenization followed by ultra-sonication. 
      The morphology and physicochemical properties of dapagliflozin-SLNs have been 
      characterized using various techniques. The optimized dapagliflozin-SLNs have a 
      particle size ranging from 100.13 ± 7.2 to 399.08 ± 2.4 nm with 68.26 ± 0.2 to 
      94.46 ± 0.7% entrapment efficiency (%EE). Dapagliflozin-SLNs were optimized using 
      a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design (BBD). Polymer concentration (X1), 
      surfactant concentration (X2), and stirring duration (X3) were chosen as 
      independent factors, whereas %EE, cumulative drug release (%CDR), and particle 
      size were selected as dependent variables. Interactions between drug substances 
      and polymers were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 
      and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 
      X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis indicated the 
      crystalline change from the drug to the amorphous crystal. Electron microscope 
      studies revealed that the SLNs' structure is nearly perfectly round. It is 
      evident from the findings that dapagliflozin-SLNs could lower elevated blood 
      glucose levels to normal in STZ-induced diabetic rats, demonstrating a better 
      hypoglycemic impact on type 2 diabetic patients. The in vivo pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of SLNs exhibited a significant rise in C(max) (1258.37 ± 1.21 
      mcg/mL), AUC (5247.04 mcg/mL), and oral absorption (2-fold) of the drug compared 
      to the marketed formulation in the Sprague Dawley rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature and describe the pharmacology, 
      pharmacokinetics, clinical safety, and efficacy of dapagliflozin, a compound 
      currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. DATA SOURCES: A search of the literature 
      was conducted via MEDLINE (1995-March 2009) and ClinicalTrials.gov using the 
      search terms dapagliflozin, SGLT2 inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transport 
      inhibition, and renal glucose reabsorption inhibition. Bibliographies of 
      identified articles were also used to identify useful references. STUDY SELECTION 
      AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language reports evaluating dapagliflozin were 
      included in this review, including abstracts and scientific presentations. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Due to the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, suboptimal 
      management of the associated hyperglycemia, morbidity and mortality associated 
      with the disease, and the limitations of currently available therapies, novel 
      therapeutic strategies are needed for its treatment. Dapagliflozin represents the 
      first selective, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that functions by 
      regulating renal glucose reabsorption. Clinical trial data are limited, but 
      available evidence supports clinically significant reductions in fasting plasma 
      glucose, postprandial plasma glucose, hemoglobin A(1c), and body weight with this 
      agent. In addition, dapagliflozin has demonstrated excellent tolerability with 
      safety data demonstrated in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dapagliflozin represents the first in a new class of drugs that may represent a 
      promising new option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Results of ongoing 
      Phase 3 clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate efficacy and safety of this 
      agent across various patient populations and clinical scenarios.

      subjects.
PG  - 105-113
LID - 10.12793/tcp.2023.31.e10 [doi]
AB  - Two open-label, randomized, two-period crossover studies were conducted to 
      investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, safety, and bioequivalence of 
      the test formulation (KD4004), a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulation of 
      dapagliflozin and metformin extended release (XR) tablets, relative to the 
      reference formulation (10 mg dapagliflozin/1,000 mg metformin XR FDC tablet) in 
      healthy subjects under fasting (Part A) and fed (Part B) conditions. After giving 
      the dose, serial blood samples were collected for a period of 48 hours. Primary 
      PK parameters (AUC(0-t) and C(max)) were used to assess bioequivalence between 
      two dapagliflozin/metformin XR (10/1,000 mg) FDC formulations under fed and 
      fasting conditions. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Part A and Part 
      B were completed by 32 and 37 subjects, respectively. Bioequivalence of the two 
      FDC formulations of dapagliflozin and metformin XR tablets was established in 
      both the fasted and the fed conditions as the 90% confidence interval of the 
      ratios of adjusted geometric means for AUC(0-t) and C(max) were contained within 
      the predefined range of 0.800-1.250 bioequivalence criteria. Single-dose 
      administration of dapagliflozin and metformin XR was safe and well tolerated as 
      the two FDC formulations. In conclusion, both FDC formulations of dapagliflozin 
      and metformin XR tablets were bioequivalent in fed and fasted subjects. All 
      treatments were well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Research Information

      (SGLT2i), is widely used in patients with T2DM. Notably, co-administration of SOR 
      with DAPA is common in clinical settings. Uridine 
      diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A9 (UGT1A9) is involved in 
      the metabolism of SOR and dapagliflozin (DAPA), and SOR is the inhibitor of 
      UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 (in vitro). Therefore, changes in UGT1A9 activity caused by SOR 
      may lead to pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs. The objective of 
      the current study was to develop an ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous 
      determination of SOR and DAPA in plasma and to evaluate the effect of the 
      co-administration of SOR and DAPA on their individual pharmacokinetic properties 
      and the mechanism involved. The rats were divided into four groups: SOR (100 
      mg/kg) alone and co-administered with DAPA (1 mg/kg) for seven days, and DAPA (1 
      mg/kg) alone and co-administered with SOR (100 mg/kg) for seven days. 
      Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was performed for plasma sample preparation, and 
      the chromatographic separation was conducted on Waters XSelect HSS T3 column with 
      a gradient elution of 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium acetate (Phase A) and 
      acetonitrile (Phase B). The levels of Ugt1a7 messenger RNA (mRNA) were determined 
      in rat liver and intestine using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR). The method was successfully applied to the study of pharmacokinetic 
      interactions. DAPA caused a significant decrease in the maximum plasma 
      concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curves 
      (AUC(0-t)) of SOR by 41.6% and 50.5%, respectively, while the apparent volume of 
      distribution (V(z/F)) and apparent clearance (CL(z/F)) significantly increased 
      2.85- and 1.98-fold, respectively. When co-administering DAPA with SOR, the 
      AUC(0-t) and the elimination half-life (t(1/2Z)) of DAPA significantly increased 
      1.66- and 1.80-fold, respectively, whereas the CL(z/F) significantly decreased by 
      40%. Results from qRT-PCR showed that, compared with control, seven days of SOR 
      pretreatment decreased Ugt1a7 expression in both liver and intestine tissue. In 
      contrast, seven days of DAPA pretreatment decreased Ugt1a7 expression only in 
      liver tissue. Therefore, pharmacokinetic interactions exist between long-term use 
      of SOR with DAPA, and UGT1A9 may be the targets mediating the interaction. Active 
      surveillance for the treatment outcomes and adverse reactions are required.

AB  - Dapagliflozin (Forxiga®) is the first in a novel class of glucose-lowering agents 
      known as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and is used in the 
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. By inhibiting the transporter protein 
      SGLT2 in the kidneys, dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading 
      to urinary glucose excretion and a reduction in blood glucose levels. Unlike oral 
      antidiabetic drugs from several other classes, the efficacy of dapagliflozin is 
      independent of insulin secretion and action. Therefore, when used in combination 
      with other antidiabetic drugs, dapagliflozin provides complementary therapy via 
      its unique mechanism of action. A consistent finding across phase III, 
      randomized, double-blind trials in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 
      diabetes was that dapagliflozin 5 or 10 mg/day for 24 weeks as monotherapy in 
      previously untreated patients, or as add-on combination therapy with metformin, 
      glimepiride, pioglitazone or insulin-based therapy, significantly reduced both 
      glycosylated haemoglobin values (primary endpoint) and fasting plasma glucose 
      levels compared with placebo. Various randomized trials have also shown 
      improvements in postprandial blood glucose with dapagliflozin monotherapy and 
      combination therapy compared with placebo. In addition, dapagliflozin was 
      noninferior to glipizide, in terms of glycaemic control after 52 weeks, when used 
      as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that was inadequately 
      controlled with metformin. In most clinical trials, dapagliflozin was associated 
      with reductions in body weight that were statistically superior to placebo or 
      active comparators. Longer-term extension studies indicate that the efficacy of 
      dapagliflozin is maintained for up to ≈2 years. Dapagliflozin was generally well 
      tolerated in clinical trials of 24 or 52 weeks duration and in extension studies 
      of up to ≈2 years. Events suggestive of genital infections and urinary tract 
      infections occurred more frequently among dapagliflozin than placebo recipients. 
      These adverse events are of special interest because they appear to be related to 
      the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin has a low propensity to 
      cause hypoglycaemia, especially when used alone or in combination with metformin, 
      although the incidence of hypoglycaemic events reported with dapagliflozin in 
      clinical trials varied depending on the background therapy. Longer-term 
      tolerability/safety data with dapagliflozin are awaited with interest. In 
      conclusion, dapagliflozin, with its unique and complementary mechanism of action, 
      appears to be an important addition to the therapeutic options for the management 
      of type 2 diabetes, particularly when used as add-on therapy.

TI  - Impact of voglibose on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in Japanese patients 
      with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 41-9

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dapagliflozin is an orally administered selective sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor under development for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin lowers blood glucose through a reduction 
      in renal glucose reabsorption. This study was performed to assess the effect of 
      the oral antidiabetic agent voglibose [0.2 mg thrice daily (t.i.d.)] at 
      steady-state, on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin 
      administered as a single oral dose (10 mg) to Japanese patients with T2DM. 
      METHODS: This was an open-label, multi-center, drug-drug interaction study. A 
      single oral dose of dapagliflozin (10 mg) was administered to 22 Japanese 
      patients with T2DM in the presence and absence of voglibose (0.2 mg t.i.d.). 
      Serial blood samples were collected before and at regular prespecified intervals 
      after each dapagliflozin dose to determine dapagliflozin plasma concentrations 
      and to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on a mixed effect analysis of 
      variance model, including the dosing condition as a fixed effect and patients as 
      a random effect, the ratios of geometric means of area under curve from time 0 to 
      infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) with and 
      without voglibose were estimated along with two-sided 90% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). RESULTS: In Japanese patients with T2DM, the exposure to dapagliflozin 
      following a single oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg was not influenced by the 
      concomitant administration of voglibose (0.2 mg t.i.d.). The geometric ratio (90% 
      CI) for dapagliflozin AUC0-inf with/without voglibose was 1.009 (0.954, 1.067), 
      and for C max 1.040 (0.899, 1.204). The median time to C max (t max) and plasma 
      clearance of dapagliflozin were also similar between treatments. The mean 
      half-life (t ½) for dapagliflozin was slightly higher when administered in 
      combination with voglibose. Dapagliflozin 10 mg was well tolerated when 
      administered alone and in combination with voglibose in Japanese patients with 
      T2DM. CONCLUSION: The results presented here support the co-administration of 
      dapagliflozin and voglibose without dose adjustment of either agent.

TI  - A model-based approach to investigating the relationship between glucose-insulin 
      dynamics and dapagliflozin treatment effect in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 991-1000
LID - 10.1111/dom.14305 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To develop a quantitative systems pharmacology model to describe the effect 
      of dapagliflozin (a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 [SGLT2] inhibitor) on 
      glucose-insulin dynamics in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and to 
      identify key determinants of treatment-mediated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
      reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Glycaemic control during dapagliflozin 
      treatment was mechanistically characterized by integrating components 
      representing dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics (PK), glucose-insulin homeostasis, 
      renal glucose reabsorption, and HbA1c formation. The model was developed using PK 
      variables, glucose, plasma insulin, and urinary glucose excretion (UGE) from a 
      phase IIa dapagliflozin trial in patients with T2DM (NCT00162305). The model was 
      used to predict dapagliflozin-induced HbA1c reduction; model predictions were 
      compared to actual data from phase III trials (NCT00528879, NCT00683878, 
      NCT00680745 and NCT00673231). RESULTS: The integrated 
      glucose-insulin-dapagliflozin model successfully described plasma glucose and 
      insulin levels, as well as UGE in response to oral glucose tolerance tests and 
      meal intake. HbA1c reduction was also well predicted. The results show that 
      dapagliflozin-mediated glycaemic control is anticorrelated to steady-state 
      insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model 
      framework is the first to integrate SGLT2 inhibitor mechanism of action with both 
      short-term glucose-insulin dynamics and long-term glucose control (HbA1c). The 
      results suggest that dapagliflozin treatment is beneficial in patients with 
      inadequate glycaemic control from insulin alone and this benefit increases as 
      insulin control diminishes.

      and angiotensin II type 1 receptor under investigation for the treatment of focal 
      segmental glomerulosclerosis and immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Dapagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, has recently been indicated in chronic 
      kidney disease. Sparsentan may be considered for concomitant use with 
      dapagliflozin. The purpose of this open-label, 1-sequence crossover study was to 
      determine whether drug-drug interactions between sparsentan and dapagliflozin 
      affect dapagliflozin pharmacokinetics (PK). In addition, exposure to the inactive 
      metabolite of dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide, was used to evaluate 
      the effect of sparsentan on the primary metabolizing enzyme of dapagliflozin, 
      uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9. The study included 22 healthy 
      adults treated with 10 mg of dapagliflozin on day 1, and 800 mg/day of sparsentan 
      on days 5-14, with a 10-mg dose of dapagliflozin coadministered on day 11. PK 
      samples were taken for dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide, and 
      sparsentan before and after treatment throughout the study. Steady-state 
      concentrations of sparsentan following daily dosing did not affect the PK of 
      single-dose dapagliflozin in healthy adults. Dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide PK 
      suggests a minimal effect of sparsentan on metabolism of dapagliflozin by uridine 
      5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9. No deaths, serious adverse events, or 
      unusual safety signals occurred. Results suggest dapagliflozin PK is not affected 
      by sparsentan daily dosing.

AB  - A review of publications devoted to the analysis of genetic polymorphisms and 
      features of the functioning of genes that affect the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) is 
      presented. Objective of the study was to reveal information about genes whose 
      polymorphism may affect the effectiveness of SGLT2i. The review was carried out 
      in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 recommendations, the search for publications 
      was carried out in the PubMed databases (including Medline), Web of Science, as 
      well as Russian scientific electronic libraries eLIBRARY.RU from 1993 to 2022. 
      Polymorphisms in the structure of several genes (SLC5A2, UGT1A9, ABCB1, PNPLA3) 
      have been described that may affect the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      complicated by diseases such as chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The information found on the genetic features 
      of the development of the effects of SGLT2i is limited to a description of the 
      differences in their pharmacokinetics. The relevance of currently available 
      pharmacogenetic studies is largely constrained by small sample sizes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic and multifactorial metabolic 
      disease, which brings great threats to public health. The morbidity of T2D keeps 
      growing, and it is estimated that the population with T2D will rise to 552 
      million throughout the world by 2030. Effective glycemic control in patients is 
      crucial for the treatment of T2D. However, with progressive deterioration of 
      disease, most patients are usually unable to achieve glycemic targets receiving 
      antidiabetic agent monotherapy. In such cases, combination therapy with different 
      mechanisms of antidiabetic agents is highly desired. In addition, combination 
      therapy can provide advantages beyond better glycemic improvement such as reduced 
      incidence of hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed 
      all the published data regarding the fixed-dose combination therapy of 
      dapagliflozin combined with metformin, including complementary mechanism of 
      action, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety. EXPERT 
      OPINION: The fixed-dose combination of dapagliflozin and metformin exerts 
      synergistic effects based on two antidiabetic agents with complementary 
      mechanisms of action. Rational co-administration of dapagliflozin and metformin 
      provides better glycemic control with potential weight loss and the reduced 
      incidence of hypoglycaemia.

AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 offer a novel approach to treating type 
      2 diabetes by reducing hyperglycaemia via increased urinary glucose excretion. In 
      the present study, the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacologic 
      properties of all six SGLT2 inhibitors commercially available in Japan were 
      investigated and compared. Based on findings in normal and diabetic mice, the six 
      drugs were classified into two categories, long-acting: ipragliflozin and 
      dapagliflozin, and intermediate-acting: tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, 
      empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin. Long-acting SGLT2 inhibitors exerted an 
      antihyperglycemic effect with lower variability of blood glucose level via a 
      long-lasting increase in urinary glucose excretion. In addition, ipragliflozin 
      and luseogliflozin exhibited superiority over the others with respect to fast 
      onset of pharmacological effect. Duration and onset of the pharmacologic effects 
      seemed to be closely correlated with the pharmacokinetic properties of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor, particularly with respect to high distribution and long retention in 
      the target organ, the kidney. While all six SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly 
      effective in increasing urinary glucose excretion and reducing hyperglycemia, our 
      findings suggest that variation in the quality of daily blood glucose control 
      associated with duration and onset of pharmacologic effects of each SGLT2 
      inhibitor might cause slight differences in rates of improvement in type 2 
      diabetes.

TI  - A Nonlinear Mixed Effects Pharmacokinetic Model for Dapagliflozin and

PG  - e42
LID - 10.1038/psp.2013.20 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in development for 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A semi-mechanistic population 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed for dapagliflozin and its inactive 
      metabolite dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (D3OG) with emphasis on renal and 
      hepatic contribution to dapagliflozin metabolism. Renal and hepatic impairment 
      decreased the clearance of dapagliflozin to D3OG and the clearance of D3OG. The 
      fraction of D3OG formed via the renal route decreased from 40-55% in subjects 
      with normal renal function (creatinine clearance (CLcr) > 80 ml/min) to 10% in 
      subjects with severe renal insufficiency (CLcr = 13 ml/min). The model-based 
      simulations suggested that the increase of systemic exposure (AUCss) of 
      dapagliflozin and D3OG was less than twofold in subjects with mild or moderate 
      renal impairment. This population modeling analysis presents a useful approach to 
      evaluate the impact of renal and hepatic function on the PK of dapagliflozin.CPT:

      reducing tablet burden and improving compliance. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the bioequivalence and tolerability of 2 FDCs of dapagliflozin and 
      metformin extended-release (XR) versus their individual component (IC) tablets. 
      METHODS: An open-label, balanced, randomized, 2-way crossover, 4-arm study was 
      conducted in 129 healthy Brazilian subjects (aged 18-55 years). Two oral doses of 
      the FDCs (5 mg dapagliflozin and 500 mg metformin XR, and 10 mg dapagliflozin and 
      1000 mg metformin XR) were evaluated in fed and fasted states. FINDINGS: Under 
      fed and fasted conditions the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 500 mg metformin XR FDC 
      showed bioequivalence to its ICs. The 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin 
      XR FDC was bioequivalent to its ICs in fed subjects. Although AUC for the 10 mg 
      dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin XR FDC was bioequivalent in fasted subjects, 
      the Cmax for metformin was not bioequivalent to its ICs in fasted subjects (upper 
      90% CI was 127.5%, and thus outside the 80%-125% bioequivalence interval). The 
      small increase in the fasted state is not considered clinically meaningful due to 
      the small magnitude of the difference (9.2%), the lack of metformin Cmax being 
      associated with efficacy or tolerability concerns, and the fasted state not being 
      the recommended state for dosing of metformin XR. The safety profile and 
      tolerability of the FDCs were similar to those of their ICs and no deaths or 
      serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: Both FDCs of dapagliflozin 
      and metformin XR were bioequivalent to their ICs in fed and fasted subjects, 
      except for the metformin Cmax from the 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin 
      XR FDC in fasted subjects. These data support the use of a dapagliflozin and 
      metformin XR FDC in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Dapagliflozin: a new sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 361-72
LID - 10.2146/ajhp140168 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacologic properties and clinical efficacy of dapagliflozin, a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes, are reviewed. SUMMARY: Dapagliflozin (Farxiga, AstraZeneca) is a 
      selective SGLT2 inhibitor approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
      glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin lowers blood 
      glucose independent of insulin secretion and action by inhibiting renal 
      reabsorption of glucose, thus promoting increased urinary excretion of glucose. 
      Dapagliflozin has been shown to improve glycemic parameters in patients with type 
      2 diabetes when used as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, 
      glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, or insulin. Dapagliflozin treatment is 
      associated with weight reduction, it has a low intrinsic propensity to cause 
      hypoglycemia, and it may offer the advantage of a complementary mechanism of 
      action when added to other therapies. During Phase III clinical trials, 
      dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with an overall frequency of adverse 
      events similar to that reported with placebo use. However, increased rates of 
      genital and, in some trials, urinary tract infections have been reported in 
      dapagliflozin-treated groups relative to placebo groups. Pooled data from 
      clinical trials indicated an imbalance in bladder cancer cases between 
      dapagliflozin-treated and placebo groups; however, most cases were diagnosed 
      within one year of exposure. Ongoing research is expected to further delineate 
      the effects of dapagliflozin on bladder cancer risk and cardiovascular safety 
      measures. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, offers a novel treatment 
      option for type 2 diabetes that is independent of insulin secretion or action.

TI  - The influence of kidney function on dapagliflozin exposure, metabolism and 
      pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 432-44
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12056 [doi]
AB  - AIM(S): This study assessed the effect of differences in renal function on the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin, a renal sodium glucose 
      co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). METHODS: A single 50 mg dose of dapagliflozin was used to assess 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in five groups: healthy non-diabetic 
      subjects; patients with T2DM and normal kidney function and patients with T2DM 
      and mild, moderate or severe renal impairment based on estimated creatinine 
      clearance. Subsequently, 20 mg once daily multiple doses of dapagliflozin were 
      evaluated in the patients with T2DM. Formation rates of dapagliflozin 
      3-O-glucuronide (D3OG), an inactive metabolite, were evaluated using human 
      isolated kidney and liver microsomes. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of 
      dapagliflozin and D3OG were incrementally increased with declining kidney 
      function. Steady-state Cmax for dapagliflozin were 4%, 6% and 9% higher and for 
      D3OG were 20%, 37% and 52% higher in patients with mild, moderate and severe 
      renal impairment, respectively, compared with normal function. AUC(0,τ) was 
      likewise higher. D3OG formation in kidney microsomes was three-fold higher than 
      in liver microsomes and 109-fold higher than in intestine microsomes. Compared 
      with patients with normal renal function, pharmacodynamic effects were attenuated 
      with renal impairment. Steady-state renal glucose clearance was reduced by 42%, 
      83% and 84% in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that both kidney and liver 
      significantly contribute to dapagliflozin metabolism, resulting in higher 
      systemic exposure with declining kidney function. Dapagliflozin pharmacodynamics 
      in diabetic subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment are consistent with 
      the observation of reduced efficacy in this patient population.

AB  - AIM: Janagliflozin is an orally selective SGLT2 inhibitor. To predict human 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) characteristics of janagliflozin. To 
      design optimal starting dose and effective dose for janagliflozin first-in-human 
      (FIH) study. METHODS: Animal PK/PD properties of janagliflozin were obtained from 
      preclinical in vivo and in vitro study. Pharmacologically effective level of same 
      class SGLT2 inhibitors were assessed through preclinical and clinical efficacy 
      data of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. Human PK parameters and 
      profiles of janagliflozin were predicted by various methods such as allometric 
      scaling (AS), dedrick and PK/PD modeling analysis. Mechanistic PK/PD model was 
      developed to describe janagliflozin-mediated impact on urinary glucose excretion 
      (UGE). Human IC(50) was scaled from rat model-estimated IC(50) by correcting 
      interspecies difference of in vitro IC(50) and plasma f(u) of rat and human. The 
      quantitative PK/PD prediction of janagliflozin was evaluated via observed PK/PD 
      profiles of healthy subjects. Predicted PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin 
      were applied in FIH dose design. Optimal starting dose was suggested by 
      considering preclinical PD and toxicity data of janagliflozin. Effective dose was 
      suggested by considering pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs. 
      RESULTS: PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin in preclinical species were 
      summarized. Pharmacologically effective level for SGLT2 inhibitors was defined as 
      25~30% ΔUGE (ΔUGE=--(PG*GFR)(within24h)) based on efficacy data of three same 
      class drugs. Human predicted CL, V(ss) and F were 1.04 L/h, 77.5 L and 0.80. 
      Predicted AUC and C(max) of janagliflozin of 10 and 50 mg were within 0.47~2.08 
      fold of observed values. Predicted human UGE(0-)24 h and UGE(0-)144 h of 10 and 
      50 mg dose range were within 0.66~1.41 fold of observed values. Optimal starting 
      dose and pharmacologically active dose (PAD) were suggested as 10 mg and 50 mg. 
      Dose range for FIH study was designed as 10-450 mg. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      predicted human PK/PD characteristics of janagliflozin based on preclinical data 
      and provide optimal dose design for janagliflozin FIH study based on 
      pharmacologically effective level of same class drugs.

      Dapagliflozin/metformin extended-release (XR) fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      tablets offer the convenience of once-daily dosing. Two pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      studies were conducted to establish bioequivalence for 2 doses of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR FDC versus the same dosage of the individual component 
      (IC) tablets in healthy adults. METHODS: Two open-label, randomized, 4-period, 
      4-arm crossover studies were conducted to assess the bioequivalence and PK 
      properties of dapagliflozin and metformin FDCs in healthy subjects under fed and 
      fasting conditions. Participants received single oral doses or once-daily dosing 
      of dapagliflozin/metformin XR (5 mg/500 mg [study 1] or 10 mg/1000 mg [study 2]) 
      for 4 days in an FDC formulation or corresponding strengths of IC tablets. 
      FINDINGS: For both of the studies, dapagliflozin and metformin 5 mg/500 mg or 10 
      mg/1000 mg FDC tablets were bioequivalent to the respective IC tablets. The 90% 
      CIs of the ratio of the adjusted geometric means for all key PK parameters (Cmax, 
      AUC0-T, and AUC0-∞) were contained within the predefined 0.80 to 1.25 range to 
      conclude bioequivalence for both dapagliflozin and metformin. Once-daily dosing 
      to steady state of each FDC tablet had no effect on the PK properties of 
      dapagliflozin or metformin. When the FDCs were administered with a light-fat 
      meal, there was no effect on metformin PK values and only a modest, nonclinically 
      meaningful effect on dapagliflozin PK values. There were no safety or 
      tolerability concerns. IMPLICATIONS: Bioequivalence of the FDCs of 
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR and the ICs was established, and no safety issues of 
      clinical concern were raised.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) is becoming a huge public health burden. New 
      diabetes drugs for type 2 diabetes (T2D), sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 
      inhibitors (SGLT2is), reduce the rate of hospitalization for HF in 
      placebo-controlled trials. AREAS COVERED: Pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin and 
      empagliflozin (in presence of renal impairment and hepatic dysfunction, two 
      comorbidities frequently associated with HF) and pharmacodynamic studies in 
      patients with HF. Main HF outcomes in T2D patients with cardiovascular risk and 
      in patients with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, with or 
      without T2D, from DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved original 
      findings and post hoc analyses. EXPERT OPINION: No clinically relevant changes 
      are expected concerning SGLT2i pharmacokinetics in patients with HF while 
      pharmacodynamic studies reported improvements in myocardium/vascular parameters, 
      biomarkers, and functional status. All SGLT2is showed a remarkable reduction in 
      hospitalization for HF in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk. 
      Furthermore, both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin improved the prognosis of 
      patients with HFrEF, independently of the presence of T2D. Similar results were 
      reported with empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF, to be confirmed with 
      dapagliflozin in an ongoing trial (DELIVER). Thus, SGLT2is offer a new 
      opportunity for the prevention and management of HF in patients with or without 
      T2D.

TI  - Lack of a Pharmacokinetic Interaction Between Saxagliptin and Dapagliflozin in 
      Healthy Subjects: A Randomized Crossover Study.

AB  - PURPOSE: This single-dose, open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment 
      crossover drug-drug interaction study was conducted to evaluate differences in 
      the pharmacokinetic properties of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin when 
      coadministered. METHODS: Healthy subjects (N = 42) were randomized to receive 
      saxagliptin 5 mg alone, dapagliflozin 10 mg alone, or saxagliptin 5 mg plus 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg coadministered; there was a washout period of ≥6 days between 
      treatments. Serial blood samples for determining saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy 
      saxagliptin (5-OH saxagliptin; major active metabolite) and dapagliflozin plasma 
      concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters were collected before and up to 60 
      hours after the dose. No interaction was to be concluded if the 90% CIs for the 
      geometric mean ratios of the combination compared with each drug given alone for 
      Cmax and AUCinf were within 0.80 to 1.25. FINDINGS: The results indicated that 
      dapagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of saxagliptin, 
      5-OH saxagliptin, or saxagliptin total active moiety and vice versa. The 90% CIs 
      for Cmax and AUCinf for all comparisons were contained entirely within the 0.80 
      to 1.25 equivalence intervals. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (apparent oral 
      clearance or half-life) of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin were similar when each 
      medicine was administered alone or when coadministered. No safety profile or 
      tolerability findings of concern were observed during the study. All adverse 
      events were mild, and no serious adverse events were reported. IMPLICATIONS: 
      These data indicate that coadministration of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin 
      exhibits no pharmacokinetic interaction and is well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT01662999.

AB  - In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), glycaemic control delays the development and slows the 
      progression of complications. Although there are numerous glucose-lowering agents 
      in clinical use, only approximately half of T2DM patients achieve glycaemic 
      control, while undesirable side-effects, such as hypoglycaemia and body weight 
      gain, often impede treatment in those taking these medications. Thus, there is a 
      need for novel agents and treatment options. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibitors (SGLT-2-i) have recently been developed for the treatment of T2DM. The 
      available data suggest a good tolerability profile for the three available drugs 
      - canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin - approved by the US Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the American market as well as in other countries. 
      The most frequently reported adverse events with SGLT-2-i are female genital 
      mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and increased urination. The 
      pharmacodynamic response to SGLT-2-i declines with increasing severity of renal 
      impairment, requiring dosage adjustments or restrictions with moderate-to-severe 
      renal dysfunction. Most patients treated with SGLT-2-i also have a modest 
      reduction in blood pressure and modest effects on serum lipid profiles, some of 
      which are beneficial (increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 
      decreased triglycerides) and others which are not (increased low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C). A number of large-scale and longer-term 
      cardiovascular trials are now ongoing. In patients treated with dapagliflozin, a 
      non-significant excess number of breast and bladder cancers has been reported; 
      considered as due to a bias, this is nevertheless being followed in the ongoing 
      trials. No other significant safety issues have been reported so far. Although 
      there is some benefit for several cardiovascular risk factors such as HbA1c, high 
      blood pressure, obesity and increases in LDL-C, adequately powered trials are 
      still required to determine the effects of SGLT-2-i on macrovascular outcomes.

TI  - Comparison of the exposure-response relationship of dapagliflozin in adult and 
      paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 685-92

AB  - AIMS: To quantitatively compare the exposure-response relationship of 
      dapagliflozin in adult and paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) and to assess the potential impact of covariate effects. METHODS: Data 
      from three clinical studies of single-dose (2.5, 5 and 10 mg), orally 
      administered dapagliflozin in adult (NCT00162305, NCT00538174) and paediatric 
      (NCT01525238) patients with T2DM were analysed to examine the relationship 
      between dapagliflozin exposure (area under concentration-time curve) and response 
      [24-h urinary glucose excretion (UGE)] using a sigmoidal maximum effect model. 
      Baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR), baseline 24-h UGE, sex and race were evaluated as covariates. RESULTS: 
      Data from 63 predominantly white or Asian (92.4%) adult and 20 paediatric (45.8% 
      white; 45.8% black) patients were included. The model appeared robust, with 
      predictions fitting well with observed data. Baseline eGFR, FPG and sex were 
      significant covariates in both populations; race was a significant covariate in 
      the paediatric population only. Model-predicted UGE response was higher in 
      paediatric (47.4, 67.5 and 85.9 g/24 h for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg) than in adult (31.2, 
      43.5 and 54.3 g/24 h for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg) patients, which may be associated with 
      the higher eGFR values in paediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: After a single oral 
      dose of dapagliflozin, adult and paediatric patients with T2DM had similar 
      exposure-response relationships after accounting for significant covariates. 
      These results support the planned dosage strategy for a phase III dapagliflozin 
      safety and efficacy study in paediatric patients with T2DM, for whom treatment 
      options are currently limited.

TI  - Evaluation of dapagliflozin in the treatment of heart failure.
PG  - 415-425

AB  - The European Society of Cardiology recently addressed the use of SGLT2 inhibitor 
      use in the treatment of heart failure (HF). Dapagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor 
      recently approved by the US FDA for treatment of patients with HF with a reduced 
      ejection fraction with a New York Heart Association classification of II-IV. 
      Dapagliflozin significantly decreases the risk of worsening HF or death from 
      cardiovascular cause compared with placebo and this risk does not differ based on 
      the presence or absence of Type 2 diabetes. This paper aims to summarize the 
      chemistry, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin; and evaluates 
      the clinical efficacy of dapagliflozin in the treatment of HF.

TI  - Rapid Determination of Dapagliflozin in Rat Plasma by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS and Its 
      Application to a Pharmacokinetic Study.
PG  - 846-851
LID - 10.1248/cpb.c22-00843 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin (DAPA), sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, is used 
      to treat Type 2 diabetes. In this study, a highly sensitive and selective 
      analytical method based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high 
      resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) was established and validated for the 
      determination of DAPA in rat plasma. The separation of DAPA and internal standard 
      (DAPA-d5) were performed on a reversed-phase ACQUITY UPLC(®) BEH C(18) column 
      (100 × 3.0 mm, 1.7 µm). The mobile phase is composed of 0.1% formic acid in water 
      (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) in gradient elution. Under the negative ion 
      mode, full MS/dd-MS(2) was adopted to collect data via Q-Orbitrap. DAPA was 
      effectively separated from matrix backgrounds within 10 min, and DAPA in plasma 
      showed a good linear relationship in the range of 10-10000 µg/L. The 
      determination coefficient (R(2)) was 0.9987, and the lower limit of 
      quantification (LLOQ) was 10 µg/L. The precision and accuracy were all less than 
      10%, and the extraction recovery of DAPA was 86.16-96.06% from plasma. This study 
      offered an efficient separation and quantification method for DAPA. The improved 
      and validated method succeeded in evaluating the pharmacokinetics of DAPA in rat 
      plasma samples after a single oral administration of 1 mg/kg.

AB  - Sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, also known as gliflozins, are a 
      new class of orally active drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes. By 
      inhibiting the SGLT responsible for the reabsorption of glucose from the kidney, 
      their use aims primarily to induce glycosuria and, as a consequence, lower 
      glycemic levels. However, their specific mechanism of action involves other 
      pharmacodynamic consequences including potentially harmful adverse reactions. 
      This manuscript reviews the physiological and pharmacological background behind 
      inhibition of SGLTs, and discusses the pharmacological aspects of the safety of 
      gliflozins.

AB  - AIM: To determine the absolute oral bioavailability (F(p.o.) ) of saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin using simultaneous intravenous ¹⁴C-microdose/therapeutic oral 
      dosing (i.v.micro + oraltherap). METHODS: The F(p.o.) values of saxagliptin and 
      dapagliflozin were determined in healthy subjects (n = 7 and 8, respectively) 
      following the concomitant administration of single i.v. micro doses with 
      unlabelled oraltherap doses. Accelerator mass spectrometry and liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to quantify the labelled and 
      unlabelled drug, respectively. RESULTS: The geometric mean point estimates (90% 
      confidence interval) F(p.o) . values for saxagliptin and dapagliflozin were 50% 
      (48, 53%) and 78% (73, 83%), respectively. The i.v.micro had similar 
      pharmacokinetics to oraltherap. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous i.v.micro + oraltherap 
      dosing is a valuable tool to assess human absolute bioavailability.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has risen in the United States 
      and worldwide, with an increase in global prevalence from 4.7% to 8.5% between 
      1980 and 2014. A variety of antidiabetic drugs are available with different 
      mechanisms of action, and multiple drugs are often used concomitantly to improve 
      glycemic control. One of the newest classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents is 
      the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or "flozins". Recent 
      clinical guidelines have suggested the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy 
      in patients for whom metformin alone does not achieve glycemic targets, or as 
      initial dual therapy with metformin in patients who present with higher glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The FDA has approved fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
      tablets with each of the three available SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) and metformin. Both drug classes are associated 
      with the rare but serious life-threatening complications that result from 
      metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis (with metformin) and euglycemic 
      diabetic ketoacidosis (with SGLT2 inhibitors). This review summarizes the current 
      literature on the pharmacokinetics and the molecular targets of metformin and 
      SGLT2 inhibitors. It also addresses the common adverse effects and highlights the 
      molecular mechanisms by which this dual antihyperglycemic therapy contributes to 
      high anion gap metabolic acidosis. In conclusion, while the combination of 
      metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors would be a better option in improving glycemic 
      control with a low risk of hypoglycemia, an increase in the risk of metabolic 
      acidosis during combination therapy may be borne in mind.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate effect of antidiabetic herb Astragali 
      Radix (AR) on pharmacokinetic behavior of dapagliflozin (DAPA) in healthy rats 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats. Methods: The T2DM rats were induced by 
      high-fat diet (HFD) and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). 
      Concentrations of DAPA in healthy and T2DM rat plasma were determined by 
      UPLC-MS/MS method. Effect of AR extract (ARE) on pharmacokinetic behavior of DAPA 
      in healthy and T2DM rats was evaluated, respectively. Results: The diabetes 
      status and co-administrated with ARE significantly affected pharmacokinetic 
      behaviors of DAPA in the rats. Compared to that in healthy rats, t (max) of DAPA 
      significantly shortened, its C (max) significantly increased in T2DM rats, and 
      its t (1/2), V, AUC, CL and MRT kept unchanged. When ARE was co-administrated 
      with DAPA, C (max) of DAPA significantly increased, its t (max) and MRT 
      significantly decreased, and its t (1/2), V, AUC and CL kept unchanged in healthy 
      rats. t (max) and C (max) of DAPA significantly decreased, its t (1/2) and V 
      significantly increased, and its AUC, CL and MRT were unchanged in T2DM rats when 
      ARE was co-administrated with DAPA. Co-administration of DAPA and ARE promoted 
      absorptive rate of DAPA, increased its extravascular tissue distribution, and 
      prolonged its duration of action. ARE did not cause accumulation of DAPA in vivo. 
      Conclusion: Both disease status of T2DM and co-administration of ARE affect 
      pharmacokinetic behavior of DAPA in vivo. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions 
      may occur in vivo when herbs and drugs are co-administrated, which may affect 
      efficacy and safety of drugs.

TI  - COMBINED TREATMENT WITH SAXAGLIPTIN PLUS DAPAGLIFLOZIN REDUCES INSULIN LEVELS BY 
      INCREASED INSULIN CLEARANCE AND IMPROVES β-CELL FUNCTION.
PG  - 258-265
LID - 10.4158/EP161323.OR [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if reduction in serum insulin with dapagliflozin plus 
      saxagliptin or dapagliflozin add-on to metformin contributed to increased insulin 
      clearance and to assess the effects of these treatments on β-cell function. 
      METHODS: Patients (glycated hemoglobin, 8 to 12%; 64 to 108 mmol/mol) were 
      randomized to 24-week, double-blind treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg/day plus 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 179), saxagliptin 5 mg/day plus placebo (n = 176), 
      or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus placebo (n = 179) added to metformin. C-peptide 
      to insulin ratio was used as an index of insulin clearance during a meal 
      tolerance test, and β-cell function was evaluated by Homeostasis Model Assessment 
      2. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, compared with baseline, saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and 
      saxagliptin + placebo increased mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) C-peptide 
      area under the curve (AUC(0-180 min)) (40.2 [9.2 to 71.3] ng/mL and 95.4 [63.4 to 
      127.4] ng/mL, respectively); no change was noted with dapagliflozin + placebo 
      (14.5 [-17.6 to 46.8] ng/mL). Insulin AUC was reduced from baseline with 
      saxagliptin + dapagliflozin (-1,120.4 [-1,633.9 to -606.9] μU/mL) and 
      dapagliflozin + placebo (-1,018.6 [-1550.5 to -486.8] μU/mL) but increased with 
      saxagliptin + placebo (661.2 [131.1 to 1,191.3] μU/mL). C-peptide to insulin 
      ratio did not change versus baseline with saxagliptin + placebo but increased 
      after saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo, largely due to 
      decreased insulin AUC with dapagliflozin. All treatments improved β-cell function 
      (mean change [95% CI] from baseline, saxagliptin+dapagliflozin: 20.6% [16.5% to 
      24.8%]; dapagliflozin + placebo: 17.0% [12.7% to 21.4%]; saxagliptin + placebo: 
      11.0% [6.6% to 15.5%]). CONCLUSION: Increased C-peptide to insulin ratio with 
      saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo add-on to metformin 
      compared with saxagliptin + placebo add-on to metformin suggests that 
      dapagliflozin increases insulin clearance and may contribute to lower circulating 
      insulin. All treatments improved β-cell function, with the greatest improvements 
      with saxagliptin + dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin + placebo. ABBREVIATIONS: A1c

AB  - The two main sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), SGLT1 and SGLT2, provide new 
      therapeutic targets to reduce hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. SGLT1 
      enables the small intestine to absorb glucose and contributes to the reabsorption 
      of glucose filtered by the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorption of most 
      of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors with varying specificities for 
      these transporters (eg, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) can slow 
      the rate of intestinal glucose absorption and increase the renal elimination of 
      glucose into the urine. Results of randomised clinical trials have shown the 
      blood glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT inhibitors in type 2 diabetes when 
      administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies 
      including insulin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss 
      and could help to reduce blood pressure. Effective SGLT2 inhibition needs 
      adequate glomerular filtration and might increase risk of urinary tract and 
      genital infection, and excessive inhibition of SGLT1 can cause gastro-intestinal 
      symptoms. However, the insulin-independent mechanism of action of SGLT inhibitors 
      seems to offer durable glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of clinically 
      significant hypoglycaemia at any stage in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. 
      SGLT inhibition might also be considered in conjunction with insulin therapy in 
      type 1 diabetes.

TI  - A Review of the Safety and Efficacy of Bexagliflozin for the Management of Type 2 
      Diabetes.
PG  - 514-522
LID - 10.1177/10600280231190443 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology of bexagliflozin in addition to its safety 
      and efficacy from available clinical trials used for its approval, as well as 
      available clinical evidence to date. DATA SOURCES: A search of the National 
      Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and 
      PubMed database was performed from inception through June 1, 2023. STUDY 
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION QUANTIFICATION: The following study designs were 
      included: meta-analyses, systematic review, clinical trial, or observational 
      study design. Abstracts and drug monographs were also reviewed. Narrative or 
      scoping reviews were excluded. Only articles in the English language and those 
      evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, or efficacy of 
      bexaglifozin in humans were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bexagliflozin reduces 
      hemoglobin A1c ~0.5% with similar reductions in systolic blood pressure and body 
      weight to other SGLT2 inhibitors. No cardiovascular outcomes trial is published, 
      nor ongoing at this time. Adverse effects are similar to other SGLT2 inhibitors 
      (genital mycotic and urinary tract infections, increased urination) including a 
      warning for lower extremity amputation similar to canagliflozin. RELEVANCE TO 
      PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING DRUGS: Although no 
      cost-effectiveness data are available, statements from the manufacturer suggest a 
      competitive price point. Given limited trial data, lower cost, if chosen, may 
      create a temporary niche for bexagliflozin pending generic availability of other 
      SGLT2 inhibitors. However, given lack of cardiovascular and renal outcome data, 
      empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or canagliflozin may be preferred. CONCLUSION: 
      Bexagliflozin appears safe and effective as monotherapy and add-on 
      pharmacological therapy for the treatment of T2D.

TI  - Urinary glucose excretion after dapagliflozin treatment: An exposure-response 
      modelling comparison between Japanese and non-Japanese patients diagnosed with 
      type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 829-836
LID - 10.1111/dom.13586 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assess the dapagliflozin exposure-response relationship in Japanese and 
      non-Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and investigate if a 
      dose adjustment is required in Japanese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data 
      from two clinical studies were used to develop a non-linear mixed effects model 
      describing the relationship between dapagliflozin exposure (area under the 
      concentration curve) and response (24-hour urinary glucose excretion [UGE]) in 
      Japanese and non-Japanese patients with T1DM. The effects of patient-level 
      characteristics (covariates; identified using a stepwise procedure) on response 
      was also assessed. Simulations were performed using median-normalized covariate 
      values. RESULTS: Data from 84 patients were included. Average self-monitored 
      blood glucose (SMBG) at day 7, change from baseline in total insulin dose at day 
      7, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) all had a significant 
      effect on 24-hours UGE, with SMBG being the most influential. Dapagliflozin 
      systemic exposure for matching doses and baseline eGFR was similar between 
      Japanese and non-Japanese patients; however, higher SMBG and a greater reduction 
      in total insulin dose was observed in the Japanese population. When the 
      significant covariates were included, the model fit the data well for both 
      populations, and accurately predicted exposure-response in the Japanese and 
      non-Japanese populations, in agreement with the observed data. CONCLUSIONS: There 
      was no difference in dapagliflozin exposure-response in Japanese and non-Japanese 
      patients with T1DM once differences in renal function, glycaemic control and 
      insulin dose reductions between studies were considered. Therefore, no dose 
      adjustment is recommended in Japanese patients with T1DM.

TI  - Interaction Between the Sodium-Glucose-Linked Transporter 2 Inhibitor 
      Dapagliflozin and the Loop Diuretic Bumetanide in Normal Human Subjects.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.117.007046 [doi]
LID - e007046
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dapagliflozin inhibits the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 in the 
      renal proximal tubule, thereby promoting glycosuria to reduce hyperglycemia in 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because these patients may require loop diuretics, and 
      sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibition causes an osmotic diuresis, we 
      evaluated the diuretic interaction between dapagliflozin and bumetanide. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Healthy subjects (n=42) receiving a fixed diet with ≈110 mmol·d(-1) 
      of Na(+) were randomized to bumetanide (1 mg·d(-1)), dapagliflozin (10 mg·d(-1)), 
      or both for 7 days, followed by 7 days of both. There were no meaningful 
      pharmacokinetic interactions. Na(+) excretion increased modestly with the first 
      dose of dapagliflozin (22±6 mmol·d(-1); P<0.005) but by more (P<0.005) with the 
      first dose of bumetanide (74±7 mmol·d(-1); P<0.005), which was not significantly 
      different from both diuretics together (80±5 mmol·d(-1); P<0.005). However, Na(+) 
      excretion with dapagliflozin was 190% greater (P<0.005) when added after 1 week 
      of bumetanide (64±6 mmol·d(-1)), and Na(+) excretion with bumetanide was 36% 
      greater (P<0.005) when added after 1 week of dapagliflozin (101±8 mmol·d(-1)). 
      Serum urate was increased 4% by bumetanide but reduced 40% by dapagliflozin or 
      20% by combined therapy (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: First-dose Na(+) excretion with 
      bumetanide and dapagliflozin is not additive, but the weekly administration of 
      one diuretic enhances the initial Na(+) excretion with the other, thereby 
      demonstrating mutual adaptive natriuretic synergy. Combined therapy reverses 
      bumetanide-induced hyperuricemia. This requires further study in diabetic 
      patients with hyperglycemia who have enhanced glycosuria and natriuresis with 
      dapagliflozin. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

AB  - Management of hypertension in diabetes is critical for reduction of 
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. While blood pressure (BP) control has 
      improved over the past two decades, the control rate is still well below 50% in 
      the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A new 
      class of oral glucose-lowering agents has recently been approved; the 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which act by eliminating 
      large amounts of glucose in the urine. Two agents, dapagliflozin and 
      canagliflozin, are currently approved in the United States and Europe, and 
      empagliflozin and ipragliflozin have reported Phase 3 trials. In addition to 
      glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with weight loss and act as 
      osmotic diuretics, resulting in a lowering of BP. While not approved for 
      BP-lowering, they may potentially aid BP goal achievement in people within 7-10 
      mm Hg of goal. It should be noted that the currently approved agents have side 
      effects that include an increased incidence of genital infections, predominantly 
      in women. The approved SGLT2 inhibitors have limited use based on kidney function 
      and should be used only in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 
      canagliflozin. Cardiovascular outcome trials are ongoing with these agents and 
      will be completed within the next 4-5 years.

AB  - Despite the availability of established treatments, heart failure (HF) is 
      associated with a poor prognosis and suboptimal management, highlighting the need 
      for new treatment and prevention options. It is suggested that sodium-glucose 
      cotransporters 2 inhibitors can provide a beneficial therapeutic approach to 
      significantly lower the disease burden associated with cardiovascular illness in 
      both patients with and without Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review focuses on 
      the therapeutic aspects of dapagliflozin in clinical practice. Future studies may 
      intend to confirm the significant clinical benefits of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors.

AB  - Diabetes, characterized by high glucose levels, has been listed to be one of the 
      world's major causes of death. Around 1.6 million deaths are attributed to this 
      disease each year. Persistent hyperglycemic conditions in diabetic patients 
      affect various organs of the body leading to diabetic complications and worsen 
      the disease condition. Current treatment strategies for diabetes include 
      biguanides, sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, 
      insulin and its analogs, DPP-4(dipeptidyl peptidase-4) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like 
      peptide) analogs. However, many side effects contributing to the devastation of 
      the disease are associated with them. Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibition has been reported to be new insulin-independent approach to diabetes 
      therapy. It blocks glucose uptake in the kidneys by inhibiting SGLT2 
      transporters, thereby promoting glycosuria. Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and 
      canagliflozin are the most widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. They are effective in 
      controlling blood glucose and HbA1c levels with few side effects including 
      hypoglycemia or weight gain which makes them preferable to other anti-diabetic 
      drugs. However, treatment is found to be associated with inter-individual drug 
      response to SGLT2 inhibitors and adverse drug reactions which are also affected 
      by genetic variations. There have been very few pharmacogenetics trials of these 
      drugs. This review discusses the various SGLT2 inhibitors, their 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and genetic variation influencing the 
      inter-individual drug response.

TI  - Common ABCB1 SNP, C3435T could affect systemic exposure of dapagliflozin in 
      healthy subject.
PG  - 212-225

AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a transporter that plays an excretory role in epithelial 
      cells. It is encoded by ABCB1, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this 
      gene can affect systemic drug exposure. Dapagliflozin and sitagliptin, used in 
      type 2 diabetes treatment, are P-gp substrates. Here, we aimed to investigate 
      whether ABCB1 polymorphisms affect dapagliflozin and sitagliptin pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) in healthy Korean subjects. The study population consisted of 100 healthy 
      Korean subjects (94 men and 6 women) who participated in four different clinical 
      trials and received dapagliflozin and sitagliptin doses of 10 and 100 mg, 
      respectively. We determined ABCB1 genotypes for the C3435T, C1236T, and G2677T/A 
      SNPs. The relationship between the genotypes and dapagliflozin PKs was examined. 
      Dapagliflozin and sitagliptin PK parameters were not statistically significantly 
      affected by ABCB1 SNP genotypes. However, homozygous 3435TT subjects showed 
      higher dapagliflozin PK parameters than CT and CC subjects. In subjects with the 
      3435TT and those with 3435CC and 3435CT genotypes, mean C(max), AUC(inf), and 
      AUC(0-1) values of dapagliflozin were 223.06 ng/mL and 194.81 ng /mL (p = 
      0.2767), 673.58 ng*h/mL and 573.96 ng*h/mL (p = 0.0492), and 128.53 ng*h/mL and 
      104.61 ng*h/mL (p = 0.2678), respectively. In summary, dapagliflozin and 
      sitagliptin PK parameters were not significantly different between individuals 
      with C1236T and C2677T/A ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms. Dapagliflozin exhibited 
      higher systemic exposure in 3435TT subjects than in CC/CT subjects.

      DPP-4 Inhibitor Combination Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 703-718

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) generally requires a combination of several pharmacological 
      approaches to control hyperglycaemia. Combining a sodium-glucose cotransporter 
      type 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I, also known as gliflozin) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      inhibitor (DPP-4I, also known as gliptin) appears to be an attractive strategy 
      because of complementary modes of action. This narrative review analyzes the 
      pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of different combined therapies with an 
      SGLT2I (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, 
      ipragliflozin, luseogliflozin, tofogliflozin) and DPP-4I (linagliptin, 
      saxagliptin, sitagliptin, teneligliptin). Drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction 
      studies do not show any significant changes in peak concentrations (C (max)) and 
      total exposure (area under the curve of plasma concentrations [AUC]) of either 
      drug when they were administered together orally compared with corresponding 
      values when each of them was absorbed alone. Two fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) 
      are already available (dapagliflozin-saxagliptin, empagliflozin-linagliptin) and 
      others are in development (ertugliflozin-sitagliptin). Preliminary results show 
      bioequivalence of the two medications administered as FDC tablets when compared 
      with coadministration of the individual tablets. Dual therapy is more potent than 
      either monotherapy in patients treated with diet and exercise or already treated 
      with metformin. SGLT2I and DPP-4I could be used as initial combination or in a 
      stepwise approach. The additional glucose-lowering effect appears to be more 
      marked when a gliflozin is added to a gliptin than when a gliptin is added to a 
      gliflozin. Combining the two pharmacological options is safe and does not induce 
      hypoglycaemia.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Reduces Urinary Albumin Excretion by Downregulating the Expression 
      of cAMP, MAPK, and cGMP-PKG Signaling Pathways Associated Genes.
PG  - 627-637
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2021.0086 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Diabetic nephropathy (DN), the most severe complication of diabetes 
      mellitus, is characterized by albuminuria and progressive loss of kidney 
      function. Dapagliflozin (DAP), a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, is an 
      oral medication that improves blood glucose control in diabetic patients. 
      However, the effects and mechanisms of DAP on DN remain unclear. Materials and 
      Methods: The effect of DAP was based on a retrospective cohort study of patients 
      who underwent 2-year surveillance, and the concentration of urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine 
      were collected after treatment with DAP. To investigate the underlying mechanisms 
      through which DAP reduces urinary albumin excretion, we used RNA-sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) to analyze gene expression in human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells treated with 
      DAP. Results: The retrospective cohort analysis indicated that DAP could reduce 
      the excretion rate of urinary albumin in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal 
      impairment. The results of the RNA-seq experiments showed 349 differentially 
      expressed genes between DAP-treated HK-2 cells and control cells. Gene ontology 
      annotation enrichment analysis showed that DAP mainly affected the expression of 
      integral component of membrane- and cell junction-related genes, while the Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed that DAP 
      primarily downregulated the expression of gene clusters associated with cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and cyclic guanosine 
      monophosphate-protein kinase G signaling pathways, which play critical roles in 
      the progression of DN. Conclusion: Our results shed light on the mechanism by 
      which DAP controls DN progression and provide a theoretical basis for the 
      clinical treatment of DN.

      Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 251-60

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, 
      pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, tolerability, dosing, drug interactions, and 
      administration of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, and comparing 
      the benefit and risk aspects of using these agents in the older adult diabetes 
      patient population. DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, AND DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: A search of PubMed using the terms "SGLT-2 inhibitors," 
      "canagliflozin," "dapagliflozin," "empagliflozin," "efficacy," and "tolerability" 
      was performed to find relevant primary literature on each of the sodium/glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors currently approved for use in type 2 
      diabetes. Phase III trials for all agents were included. All English-language 
      articles from 2010 to 2015 appearing in these searches were reviewed for 
      relevance to this paper. In addition, related articles suggested in the PubMed 
      search were also reviewed. The SGLT-2 inhibitors have shown a reduction in 
      hemoglobin A1c values and fasting plasma glucose levels with a low incidence of 
      hypoglycemia. The incidence of mycotic infections is increased in patients taking 
      an SGLT-2 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors may be a viable treatment 
      option for patients not controlled on other oral agents. The risk of hypoglycemia 
      is small. However, the clinical efficacy and tolerability of these agents has not 
      been fully elucidated in older and frail patients.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Aggravates Renal Injury via Promoting Gluconeogenesis in db/db 
      Mice.
PG  - 1747-1758
LID - 10.1159/000487783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin is 
      widely used for lowering blood glucose and its usage is limited in type 2 
      diabetes mellitus patients with moderate renal impairment. As its effect on 
      kidney function is discrepant and complicated, the aim of this study is to 
      determine the effect of dapagliflozin on the progression of diabetic nephropathy 
      and related mechanisms. METHODS: Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 wild-type and db/db 
      mice were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. Body 
      weight, blood glucose, insulin tolerance, glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance 
      and 24-hour urine were measured every 4 weeks. At 24 weeks of age, renal function 
      was evaluated by blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine clearance, urine output, 
      urinary albumin excretion, Periodic Acid-Schiff staining, Masson's trichrome 
      staining and electron microscopy. Changes in insulin signaling and gluconeogenic 
      key regulatory enzymes were detected using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: 
      Dapagliflozin did not alleviate but instead aggravated diabetic nephropathy 
      manifesting as increased levels of microalbuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, and 
      glomerular and tubular damage in db/db mice. Despite adequate glycemic control by 
      dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion increased after administration before 24 
      weeks of age and was likely associated with renal impairment. Increased urinary 
      glucose excretion was mainly derived from the disturbance of glucose homeostasis 
      with elevated hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis induced by dapagliflozin. 
      Although it had no effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, 
      dapagliflozin further induced the expression of gluconeogenic key rate-limiting 
      enzymes through increasing the expression levels of FoxO1 in the kidney and 
      liver. CONCLUSION: These experimental results indicate that dapagliflozin 
      aggravates diabetes mellitus-induced kidney injury, mostly through increasing 
      gluconeogenesis.

PG  - 327-34

AB  - The global incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing. Hyperglycemia 
      contributes to both the complications associated with diabetes mellitus and 
      progression of the underlying disease. New agents that lower blood glucose levels 
      are therefore needed to help slow disease progression and reduce disease 
      complications. The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) reabsorbs glucose in 
      the kidney. Inhibition of SGLT2 by new agents, such as dapagliflozin, has the 
      potential to reduce hyperglycemia by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the 
      kidney. Preclinical trials demonstrated that dapagliflozin is a potent and 
      selective inhibitor of SGLT2. It has shown linear pharmacokinetics over the dose 
      range of 2.5 - 500 mg/day, is not significantly influenced when taken with food 
      and is primarily eliminated via urinary excretion. Clinical trials have shown 
      that dapagliflozin treatment induces glucosuria and improves glycemic parameters 
      in patients with type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of SGLT2 is a new and promising 
      approach to treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. This article reviews the role of 
      dapagliflozin as an emerging treatment option in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitor, reduces hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by 
      increasing urinary glucose excretion. Owing to its mechanism of action, 
      dapagliflozin could potentially affect the renal tubular transportation of bone 
      minerals. Therefore, markers of bone formation and resorption and bone mineral 
      density (BMD) were evaluated in patients with T2DM after 50 weeks of 
      dapagliflozin treatment. METHODS: This international, multi-centre, randomized, 
      parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      NCT00855166) enrolled patients with T2DM (women 55-75 years and men 30-75 years; 
      HbA1c 6.5-8.5%; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) ; body weight ≤ 120 kg) whose T2DM was 
      inadequately controlled on metformin. One hundred and eighty-two patients were 
      randomly assigned 1:1 to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo added to 
      open-label metformin for a 24-week double-blind treatment period followed by a 
      78-week site- and patient-blinded extension period. At week 50, serum markers of 
      bone formation (procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide; P1NP) and resorption 
      (C-terminal cross-linking telopeptides of type I collagen; CTX), bone mineral 
      density (BMD) as assessed by standardized Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) 
      measurements and adverse events of fracture were evaluated as safety objectives. 
      RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients (90.7%) completed the first 50 
      weeks. Compared with placebo, no significant changes from baseline in P1NP, CTX 
      or BMD were identified over 50 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, with no 
      significant treatment-by-gender interactions. No fractures were reported. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin had no effect on markers of bone formation and 
      resorption or BMD after 50 weeks of treatment in both male and post-menopausal 
      female patients whose T2DM was inadequately controlled on metformin.

AB  - Combining a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and a sodium-glucose cotransporter 
      type 2 inhibitor is an attractive option to treat hyperglycaemia in type 2 
      diabetes. Areas covered: The saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin combination is 
      carefully analysed, focusing on: 1) pharmacokinetic properties, 2) 
      pharmacodynamics data, and 3) results of randomised controlled trials (dual 
      combination versus either monotherapy, sequential therapy saxagliptin added to 
      dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin added to saxagliptin). Expert opinion: 
      Pharmacokinetic findings demonstrate the absence of drug-drug interaction and the 
      bioequivalence of the FDC compared with separated tablets. Pharmacodynamic 
      observations confirm a complementary mode of action of the two agents. Dual 
      saxagliptin-dapagliflozin therapy is more potent than either monotherapy. It may 
      be used as an initial combination, although this approach remains debatable and 
      should probably be reserved in case of high glycated hemoglobin, or a stepwise 
      strategy, according to a personalized approach. The developed 
      saxagliptin-dapagliflozin FDC may simplify anti-hyperglycemic therapy and improve 
      drug compliance.

PG  - 669-83
LID - 10.1586/ecp.11.54 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin is a highly selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor 
      developed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its inhibition of 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 blocks glucose reabsorption in the proximal 
      tubule of the kidney, increasing renal glucose excretion via the urine, resulting 
      in reduction of glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose and postprandial 
      plasma glucose in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin are suitable for once-daily dosing. 
      Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control when used as monotherapy and when used in 
      combination with other antidiabetic treatments. Throughout all phases of clinical 
      studies, dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated. Increased events suggestive 
      of urinary tract and genital infections have been reported; most resolved with 
      conventional treatment. Unexpected numerical imbalances between dapagliflozin and 
      comparator were noted for breast and bladder cancers. The potential for increased 
      cancer risk with dapagliflozin needs to be further assessed.

TI  - Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and their mechanism for improving 
      glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 33-48
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2014.10.2819 [doi]
AB  - Most antihyperglycemic agents available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) have insulin-dependent mechanisms of action; that is, they either 
      stimulate insulin production (sulfonylureas, glinides, incretin mimetics, 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors), improve insulin sensitivity 
      (thiazolidinediones, biguanides), or directly augment endogenous insulin (basal 
      and prandial insulins). As β-cell function deteriorates, combination therapy is 
      usually needed to effectively control glycemia. Moreover, some antihyperglycemic 
      agents are associated with adverse effects, such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. 
      A novel approach for treating T2DM is to inhibit renal glucose reabsorption 
      through inhibition of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), which is 
      responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal 
      tubule. By reducing the renal capacity to reabsorb filtered glucose, SGLT2 
      inhibitors increase excretion of excess glucose in urine, thereby decreasing 
      plasma glucose concentration. Thus, although glucosuria is often viewed as an 
      indicator of systemic hyperglycemia, this perception needs to be modified in 
      patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors where glucosuria is an indicator of the 
      desired treatment effect. Currently, 2 SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and 
      dapagliflozin, are approved in the United States for the treatment of patients 
      with T2DM; other SGLT2 inhibitors are in various stages of clinical development. 
      Clinical studies in patients with T2DM on a variety of background diabetes 
      treatments have demonstrated the efficacy of canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in 
      improving glycemic control and reducing body weight and blood pressure. 
      Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are generally well tolerated, with a low risk of 
      hypoglycemia when not used in combination with insulin and/or sulfonylurea. 
      Higher incidences of genital mycotic infections and adverse events related to 
      osmotic diuresis and volume depletion were observed with both agents; they were 
      generally mild or moderate and infrequently led to study discontinuation. Based 
      on current evidence, SGLT2 inhibitors provide an important new treatment option 
      for patients with T2DM.

TI  - Changes in Levels of Biomarkers Associated with Adipocyte Function and Insulin 
      and Glucagon Kinetics During Treatment with Dapagliflozin Among Obese Type 2 
      Diabetes Mellitus Patients.
PG  - 255-261
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate changes in levels of biomarkers 
      associated with adipocyte function and insulin and glucagon kinetics after a meal 
      tolerance test (MTT) during treatment with dapagliflozin among obese type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. METHODS: T2DM patients with hemoglobin A1c 
      (HbA1c) levels >6.5 % and body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2) were treated with 
      dapagliflozin 5 mg/day for at least 12 weeks. HbA1c, body weight, ketone bodies, 
      adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and C-reactive protein 
      (CRP) were measured before and after treatment with dapagliflozin. A subset of 
      patients underwent an MTT. RESULTS: Of 27 participating patients (mean age 
      47.9 years; 17 males), five were drug-naive and 22 were treated with other 
      antidiabetic agents, including insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
      receptor agonists. Following treatment with dapagliflozin, HbA1c levels 
      significantly improved (7.44 ± 0.56 to 6.70 ± 0.0.57 %; p < 0.01), body weight 
      significantly decreased (90.9 ± 16.5 to 87.1 ± 15.9 kg; p < 0.01), ketone bodies 
      increased, adiponectin significantly increased, and high-sensitivity CRP tended 
      to decrease. During the MTT, blood glucose ΔAUC(2) significantly decreased, 
      glucagon ΔAUC(2) increased, and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) did not change in 11 
      of 27 patients. CONCLUSION: Although ketone bodies increased significantly, 
      adiponectin increased and high-sensivity CRP decreased significantly. These 
      findings suggest that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may 
      potentially improve adipocyte function in treating obese T2DM patients.

TI  - Effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin, a selective 
      SGLT2 inhibitor, in healthy subjects.
PG  - 770-3
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01397.x [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter type 2 that is being developed for the treatment of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. This open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment (single 
      doses of 10-mg dapagliflozin fasted or fed), crossover study was conducted to 
      evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin 
      in 14 healthy subjects. Compared to the fasted state, a high-fat meal decreased 
      mean dapagliflozin maximum plasma concentrations (C(max) ) by 31%, increased the 
      time to C(max) (T(max) ) by 1 h, but did not affect overall dapagliflozin 
      systemic exposure [area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)]. As the 
      cumulative (daily) amount of glucose excreted in the urine induced by 
      dapagliflozin is dependent upon dapagliflozin AUC, the effect of food on 
      dapagliflozin C(max) is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on 
      dapagliflozin's efficacy. On the basis of these findings, dapagliflozin can be 
      administered without regard to meals.

TI  - Inhibition of SGLT2 Preserves Function and Promotes Proliferation of Human Islets 
      Cells In Vivo in Diabetic Mice.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10020203 [doi]
LID - 203
AB  - Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used for the 
      treatment of diabetes. This study examines the effects of dapagliflozin on human 
      islets, focusing on alpha and beta cell composition in relation to function in 
      vivo, following treatment of xeno-transplanted diabetic mice. Mouse beta cells 
      were ablated by alloxan, and dapagliflozin was provided in the drinking water 
      while controls received tap water. Body weight, food and water intake, plasma 
      glucose, and human C-peptide levels were monitored, and intravenous 
      arginine/glucose tolerance tests (IVarg GTT) were performed to evaluate islet 
      function. The grafted human islets were isolated at termination and stained for 
      insulin, glucagon, Ki67, caspase 3, and PDX-1 immunoreactivity in dual and triple 
      combinations. In addition, human islets were treated in vitro with dapagliflozin 
      at different glucose concentrations, followed by insulin and glucagon secretion 
      measurements. SGLT2 inhibition increased the animal survival rate and reduced 
      plasma glucose, accompanied by sustained human C-peptide levels and improved 
      islet response to glucose/arginine. SGLT2 inhibition increased both alpha and 
      beta cell proliferation (Ki67(+)glucagon(+) and Ki67(+)insulin(+)) while 
      apoptosis was reduced (caspase3(+)glucagon(+) and caspase3(+)insulin(+)). Alpha 
      cells were fewer following inhibition of SGLT2 with increased glucagon/PDX-1 
      double-positive cells, a marker of alpha to beta cell transdifferentiation. In 
      vitro treatment of human islets with dapagliflozin had no apparent impact on 
      islet function. In summary, SGLT2 inhibition supported human islet function in 
      vivo in the hyperglycemic milieu and potentially promoted alpha to beta cell 
      transdifferentiation, most likely through an indirect mechanism.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter Inhibitors for the Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes 
      Mellitus.
PG  - 991-1000
LID - 10.1007/s40261-020-00949-9 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors are a new class of oral antihyperglycemic 
      drugs that have been approved for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors reduce glucose reabsorption in 
      the kidneys, which lowers blood glucose. In addition, they offer significant 
      cardiovascular benefits and renal protection. Multiple phase III trials of 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes have 
      been completed. The European Medicines Agency approved dapagliflozin as an 
      adjuvant therapy to insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes who have poor blood 
      glucose control with the optimal dose of insulin alone (body mass index ≥ 27 
      kg/m(2)). As adjuvants to insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes, 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors improve blood glucose control and reduce 
      total daily insulin dose and body weight. However, there is also concern about 
      diabetic ketoacidosis caused by sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors. In this 
      review, the mechanisms of hypoglycemic action, pharmacokinetics, clinical 
      efficacy, and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors for the treatment 
      of type 1 diabetes are discussed.

TI  - Model-Informed Pediatric Dose Selection for Dapagliflozin by Incorporating 
      Developmental Changes.
PG  - 108-118
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12577 [doi]
AB  - This analysis reports a quantitative modeling and simulation approach for oral 
      dapagliflozin, a primarily uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 
      (UGT)-metabolized human sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 selective inhibitor. A 
      mechanistic dapagliflozin physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was 
      developed using in vitro metabolism and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data and 
      verified for context of use (e.g., exposure predictions in pediatric subjects 
      aged 1 month to 18 years). Dapagliflozin exposure is challenging to predict in 
      pediatric populations owing to differences in UGT1A9 ontogeny maturation and 
      paucity of clinical PK data in younger age groups. Based on the exposure-response 
      relationship of dapagliflozin, twofold acceptance criteria were applied between 
      model-predicted and observed drug exposures and PK parameters (area under the 
      curve and maximum drug concentration) in various scenarios, including monotherapy 
      in healthy adults (single/multiple dose), monotherapy in hepatically or renally 
      impaired patients, and drug-drug interactions with UGT1A9 modulators, such as 
      mefenamic acid and rifampin. The PBPK model captured the observed exposure within 
      twofold of the observed monotherapy data in adults and adolescents and in special 
      population. As a guide to determining dosing regimens in pediatric studies, the 
      verified PBPK model, along with UGT enzyme ontogeny maturation understanding, was 
      used for predictions of dapagliflozin monotherapy exposures in pediatric subjects 
      aged 1 month to 18 years that best matched exposure in adult patients with a 
      10-mg single dose of dapagliflozin.

TI  - Effects of dapagliflozin on insulin-requirement, glucose excretion and 
      ß-hydroxybutyrate levels are not related to baseline HbA1c in youth with type 1 
      diabetes.
PG  - 1635-1639
LID - 10.1111/dom.12975 [doi]
AB  - Youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) infrequently achieve HbA1c targets. Therefore, 
      this placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study was set up to assess the 
      safety, effect and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin 
      (DAPA) as add-on to insulin in relationship to HbA1c in youth. A total of 33 
      youths (14 males, median age 16 years, diabetes duration 8 years) were included 
      and stratified into 3 baseline HbA1c categories (<7.5%, 7.5%-9.0% or >9.0; n = 11 
      each). During the study period of 24 hours, intravenous insulin administration 
      and glucose-infusion kept blood glucose levels at 160 to 220 mg/dL. DAPA reduced 
      mean insulin dose by 13.6% ( P  < .0001 by ANOVA) and increased urinary glucose 
      excretion by 610% (143.4 vs 22.4 g/24 h; P  < .0001), both irrespective of 
      baseline HbA1c. Six independent episodes in 6 patients with plasma 
      ß-hydroxybutyrate levels between ≥0.6 and <1.0 mmol/L were observed after liquid 
      meal challenges, 5 episodes in the DAPA group and 1 in the placebo group. This 
      study provides a proof-of-concept, irrespective of preexisting HbA1c levels, for 
      adjunct SGLT2-inhibitor therapy in the paediatric age group by lowering insulin 
      dose and increasing glucose excretion.

TI  - Glucose dynamics and mechanistic implications of SGLT2 inhibitors in animals and 
      humans.
PG  - S20-7
LID - 10.1038/ki.2010.512 [doi]
AB  - Glucose is freely filtered in the glomeruli before being almost entirely 
      reabsorbed into circulation from the proximal renal tubules. The sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), present in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, is 
      responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce 
      glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion. In animal models and 
      humans with type 2 diabetes, this effect is associated with reduced fasting and 
      postprandial blood glucose levels, and reduced hemoglobin A1c. Animal studies 
      suggest that reduction of hyperglycemia with SGLT2 inhibitors may also improve 
      insulin sensitivity and preserve β-cell function. Urinary excretion of excess 
      calories with SGLT2 inhibitors is also associated with reduction in body weight. 
      Modest reductions in blood pressure have been noted with SGLT2 inhibitors, 
      consistent with a mild diuretic action. Some C-glucoside SGLT2 inhibitors, such 
      as dapagliflozin, have pharmacokinetic properties that make them amenable to 
      once-daily dosing.

TI  - Development of Oral Lipid Based Nano-formulation of Dapagliflozin: Optimization, 
      in vitro Characterization and ex vivo Intestinal Permeation Study.
PG  - 1389-1401
LID - 10.5650/jos.ess20162 [doi]
AB  - The oral route is the most prevalent route of drug administration among various 
      routes. Dapagliflozin is an oral hypoglycemic drug used for lowering the blood 
      glucose level. The objective of this work is to developed and optimized 
      dapagliflozin loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (DG-NLCs) for the improvement 
      of oral delivery. DG-NLCs were prepared by a high-pressure homogenization method 
      (hot) and optimized by Box-Behnken design software using lipid, surfactant, and 
      homogenization cycle as an independent variable. DG-NLCs were evaluated for 
      particle size (Y(1)), entrapment efficiency (Y(2)), drug release (Y(3)). The 
      DG-NLCs were further evaluated for morphology, thermal and X-ray diffraction 
      analysis, ex-vivo intestinal permeation, and stability study. Particle size (nm), 
      entrapment efficiency (%) and drug release (%) of all seventeen formulations were 
      found in the range of 113.71-356.22 nm, 60.43-96.54% and 63.44-83.62% 
      respectively. Morphology of optimized formulation exhibited spherical in shape 
      confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Thermal and X-ray diffraction 
      analysis of NLCs showed the drug was solubilized and lost the crystallinity. 
      DG-NLCs-opt exhibited dual release pattern initial fast and later 
      sustained-release (90.01±2.01% in 24 h) whereas DG-dispersion showed 31.54±1.87% 
      release in 24 h. Korsmeyer-Peppas model was found to be the best fit model 
      (R(2)=0.999). The DG-NLCs-opt exhibited significant-high (p < 0.05, 1.293 
      µg/cm(2)/h) flux than DG-dispersion (0.2683 µg/cm(2)/h). Apparent permeation 
      coefficient of DG-NLCs-opt was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05, 
      4.14×10(-5) cm/min) than DG-dispersion (8.61×10(-6) cm/min). The formulation 
      showed no significant changes (p < 0.05) on six months of storage study at 
      25±2°C/60±5%RH. The finding concluded that quality by design (QbD) based lipid 
      nanocarrier for oral delivery could be a promising approach of dapagliflozin for 
      the management of diabetes.

TI  - Dapagliflozin maintains glycaemic control while reducing weight and body fat mass 
      over 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on 
      metformin.
PG  - 159-69
LID - 10.1111/dom.12189 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin, a highly selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 
      2 (SGLT2), reduces hyperglycaemia and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) by increasing urinary glucose excretion. Long-term glycaemic 
      control, body composition and bone safety were evaluated in patients with T2DM 
      after 102 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. METHODS: This randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT00855166) enrolled patients with T2DM 
      [mean: age 60.7 years; HbA1c 7.2%; body mass index (BMI) 31.9 kg/m(2) ; body 
      weight 91.5 kg] inadequately controlled on metformin. Patients (N = 182) were 
      randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo added to 
      open-label metformin for a 24-week double-blind treatment period followed by a 
      78-week site- and patient-blinded extension period. At week 102, changes from 
      baseline in HbA1c, weight, waist circumference, total body fat mass as measured 
      by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), serum markers of bone turnover, bone 
      mineral density (BMD) as measured by DXA, and adverse events were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: A total of 140 patients (76.9%) completed the study. Over 102 weeks, 
      dapagliflozin-treated patients showed reductions in HbA1c by -0.3%, weight by 
      -4.54 kg, waist circumference by -5.0 cm and fat mass by -2.80 kg without 
      increase in rate of hypoglycaemia. Compared with placebo, no meaningful changes 
      from baseline in markers of bone turnover or BMD were identified over 102 weeks. 
      One fracture occurred in each treatment group. The frequency of urinary tract 
      infection (UTI) and genital infection was similar in both treatment groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Over 102 weeks, dapagliflozin improved glycaemic control, and 
      reduced weight and fat mass, without affecting markers of bone turnover or BMD in 
      patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin.

TI  - Effects of dapagliflozin in experimental sepsis model in rats.
PG  - 213-221

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects 
      of dapagliflozin in an experimental sepsis model in rats. METHODS: Saline (1 
      mL/kg, p.o.) or dapagliflozin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered to Sprague-Dawley 
      rats for 5 days prior to the surgical procedures. Under anesthesia, sepsis was 
      induced by cecal ligation puncture, while sham control groups underwent 
      laparotomy only. Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose levels were 
      measured in serum samples and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione 
      (GSH), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, 
      caspase 8, and caspase 9 were determined in tissue samples (kidney, liver, and 
      lung). Histological evaluation was also performed. RESULTS: The administration of 
      dapagliflozin in a sepsis model reduced oxidative stress (MDA), increased 
      antioxidant levels (GSH), and reduced inflammation (MPO) in the kidney (p<0.05). 
      Dapagliflozin also decreased oxidative stress (MDA) in lung tissue and decreased 
      inflammation (MPO) in lung and liver tissue (p<0.05). Caspase 8 and 9 levels in 
      kidney, lung, and liver tissue were increased (p<0.05) in the dapagliflozin group 
      compared with the sepsis group. According to the histopathological results, 
      sepsis was moderately improved in renal tissue and slightly attenuated in lung 
      and liver tissue with the administration of dapagliflozin. CONCLUSION: 
      Dapagliflozin had a preventive effect on sepsis-induced kidney damage, but the 
      protective effect was mild in lung and liver tissue in the present study.

TI  - Clinical potential relevance of metabolic properties of SGLT2 inhibitors in 
      patients with heart failure.
PG  - 1273-1285
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2018.1551360 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 2% of the population 
      worldwide, remaining a major cause of hospitalization and mortality despite 
      innovative therapeutic approaches introduced in the past few decades. Type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) contributes significantly to end-organ damage and 
      HF-related complications and is associated with worse clinical status and 
      increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HF with reduced 
      (HFrEF) or with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), compared to HF patients 
      without T2DM. Recently, a novel class of antidiabetic drugs has been introduced: 
      sodium glucose co-trasport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Initially designed for patients 
      with T2DM to reduce kidney blood glucose resorption, SGLT2i rapidly gained 
      attention among HF specialists since they were able to show a beneficial 
      prognostic impact in patients affected by HF and T2DM, even independently from 
      the glycemic control as suggested by the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS trials. 
      Areas covered: The present review focuses on the mechanisms and the current 
      clinical evidence supporting the use of SGLT2i in HF patients with T2DM. 
      Moreover, the SGLT2i pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties will be 
      presented in order to better understand the rationale and the design of the 
      ongoing clinical trials investigating directly the effect of this new class of 
      drugs in patients with HF, even independently from T2DM. Expert opinion: SGLT2i 
      are emerging as an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of T2DM and 
      current evidence has unexpectedly demonstrated a robust cardiovascular protection 
      in HF patients with T2DM. Therefore, ongoing clinical trials are investigating 
      directly the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF, even 
      independently from T2DM. However, it is methodologically disappointing that the 
      mechanisms underlying the encouraging results in cardiovascular protection of 
      this drug class are still not fully understood. A better understanding of the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of SGLT2i is necessary in order to 
      better determine the effect of this new class of drugs in patients with HF.

TI  - Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin, a novel sodium-glucose 
      transporter 2 inhibitor, and metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride or sitagliptin 
      in healthy subjects.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01314.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by selectively inhibiting 
      renal sodium-glucose transporter 2, an insulin-independent mechanism of action 
      that may be complementary to that of other oral antidiabetes drugs. The current 
      studies assessed the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between 
      dapagliflozin and pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin in healthy 
      subjects following single-dose administration. METHODS: In open-label, 
      randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover studies, 24 subjects received 
      50 mg dapagliflozin, 45 mg pioglitazone or the combination, while 18 subjects 
      received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 1000 mg metformin or the combination. In an 
      open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover study, 
      18 subjects first received 20 mg dapagliflozin, 4 mg glimepiride or the 
      combination, and afterward 100 mg sitagliptin or sitagliptin plus 20 mg 
      dapagliflozin. Blood samples were taken over 72 h of each treatment period. Lack 
      of PK interaction was defined as the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence 
      interval (CI) for combination:monotherapy being within the range of 0.80-1.25. 
      RESULTS: Co-administration of dapagliflozin with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin had no effect on dapagliflozin maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max) ) or area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). 
      Similarly, dapagliflozin did not affect the C(max) or AUC for the co-administered 
      drug, except for slight extensions of the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means 
      for glimepiride AUC (upper limit 1.29) and pioglitazone C(max) (lower limit 
      0.75). All monotherapies and combination therapies were well tolerated. 
      CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin can be co-administered with pioglitazone, metformin, 
      glimepiride or sitagliptin without dose adjustment of either drug.

      type II diabetes.
PG  - 781-790
LID - 10.1080/14656566.2019.1583210 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating data from recent studies has altered the gold standard of care for 
      diabetes treatment. In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) or those at high risk for CVD, subsequently to 
      lifestyle changes and metformin therapy, the administration of an SGLT-2 
      inhibitor with established benefits for cardiovascular outcome (CVOT) should be 
      considered. Areas covered: Tofogliflozin is the most selective SGLT-2 inhibitor 
      and has been approved for the treatment of T2D in Japan. This review summarizes 
      the available data on Tofogliflozin as compared to other SGLT-2 inhibitors, and 
      primarily the three SGLT-2 inhibitors with published CVOT: Empagliflozin, 
      Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin. Expert opinion: Tofogliflozin's higher 
      selectivity profile increases the positive effects on cardiovascular (CV) 
      outcomes and death and reduces side effects. However, the clinical data on 
      Tofogliflozin from both clinical and real-world studies remain sparse and much 
      less abundant than the other main 3 SGLT-2 inhibitors, thus calling for caution 
      and underscoring the need for further research.

TI  - DPP-4 inhibitor plus SGLT-2 inhibitor as combination therapy for type 2 diabetes: 
      from rationale to clinical aspects.
PG  - 1407-1417
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease with multiple defects, which generally 
      require a combination of several pharmacological approaches to control 
      hyperglycemia. Combining a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and a 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor (SGT2i) appears to be an attractive 
      approach. Area covered: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze 
      the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical experience of different 
      gliptin-gliflozin combinations. Expert opinion: There is a strong rationale for 
      combining a DPP-4i and a SGLT2i in patients with T2D because the two drugs exert 
      different and complementary glucose-lowering effects. Dual therapy (initial 
      combination or stepwise approach) is more potent than either monotherapy in 
      patients treated with diet and exercise or already treated with metformin. 
      Combining the two pharmacological options is safe and does not induce 
      hypoglycemia. The additional glucose-lowering effect is more marked when a 
      gliflozin is added to a gliptin than when a gliptin is added to a gliflozin. Two 
      fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) are already available (saxagliptin-dapagliflozin 
      and linagliptin-empagliflozin) and others are in current development. 
      Bioequivalence of the two compounds given as FDC tablets was demonstrated when 
      compared with coadministration of the individual tablets. FDCs could simplify the 
      anti-hyperglycaemic therapy and improve drug compliance.

TI  - Evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes: pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicological considerations.
PG  - 647-63
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2014.873788 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2), which 
      increase urinary glucose excretion independently of insulin, are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). AREAS 
      COVERED: An extensive literature search was performed to analyze the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics, toxicological issues and safety concerns of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in humans. This review focuses on three compounds 
      (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin) with results obtained in healthy 
      volunteers (including drug-drug interactions), patients with T2DM (single dose 
      and multiple doses) and special populations (those with renal or hepatic 
      impairment). EXPERT OPINION: The three pharmacological agents share an excellent 
      oral bioavailability, long half-life allowing once-daily administration, low 
      accumulation index and renal clearance, the absence of active metabolites and a 
      limited propensity to drug-drug interactions. No clinically relevant changes in 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in T2DM patients or in patients with 
      mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Adverse events are a slightly 
      increased incidence of mycotic genital and rare benign urinary infections. SGLT2 
      inhibitors have the potential to reduce several cardiovascular risk factors, and 
      cardiovascular outcome trials are currently ongoing. The best positioning of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors in the armamentarium for treating T2DM is still a matter of 
      debate.

TI  - Associations of Plasma Concentration Profiles of Dapagliflozin, a Selective 
      Inhibitor of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter Type 2, with Its Effects in Japanese 
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 10.3390/ph15020203 [doi]

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the long-term plasma concentration profiles 
      of dapagliflozin and its effects on the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, body 
      weight, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 72 Japanese 
      outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving metformin and a 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. At baseline, HbA1c level, body weight, and eGFR 
      were 6.9 ± 0.6%, 77.9 ± 13.5 kg, and 78.8 ± 20.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. 
      A once-daily oral dose of 5 mg dapagliflozin was administered, and its trough 
      plasma concentrations were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. In this study, 
      the patients with stable dapagliflozin concentrations were defined, based on a 
      well-organized clinical trial, as those with average plasma concentrations of 2-5 
      ng/mL with a coefficient of variation <30%; these values were achieved if 
      patients complied with their once-daily dosage. Multivariate analysis showed a 
      significant decrease in the HbA1c levels among patients with stable 
      concentrations (-0.6 ± 0.4%, p < 0.01), which was greater than the mean change 
      among all 72 patients (-0.2 ± 0.5%, p < 0.01). The patients' mean body weight 
      also decreased (-2.3 ± 4.0 kg, p = 0.060). Average plasma concentrations ranged 
      from 1.6 to 11.8 ng/mL; however, multivariate analysis indicated it was unrelated 
      to the HbA1c-lowering effect. In conclusion, the long-term stability of plasma 
      dapagliflozin concentration was important in lowering HbA1c level, and a 
      once-daily oral dose of 5 mg was sufficient in achieving this effect.

AB  - AIMS: DWP16001 is a novel sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor under 
      development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study was 
      conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of 
      DWP16001 after single and multiple doses in healthy subjects. METHODS: A 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, single- and 
      multiple-dose study was conducted. Twelve subjects in each dose group received a 
      single dose (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 5.0 mg) or multiple doses (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 
      or 2.0 mg once daily for 15 consecutive days) of DWP16001, dapagliflozin 10 mg or 
      placebo at a ratio of 8:2:2. Serial blood and interval urine samples were 
      collected for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. The safety and 
      tolerability of DWP16001 were also assessed. RESULTS: A dose-dependent increase 
      in the urinary glucose excretion was observed after a single dose, and the steady 
      state urinary glucose excretion was 50-60 g/d after multiple doses in the dose 
      range of 0.3-2.0 mg. DWP16001 was rapidly absorbed with the time to peak plasma 
      concentration of 1.0-3.0 hours, and it exhibited a mean elimination half-life of 
      13-29 hours. The systemic exposure to DWP16001 increased proportionally with 
      multiple dose administrations in the range of 0.1-2.0 mg. DWP16001 was well 
      tolerated in all dose groups. CONCLUSION: DWP16001 induced glucosuria in a 
      dose-dependent manner, and systemic exposure was observed after multiple doses. 
      DWP16001 was well tolerated in single oral doses of up to 5.0 mg and in multiple 
      oral doses of up to 2.0 mg.

TI  - A new HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      and metformin in plasma and its application to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - e4663
LID - 10.1002/bmc.4663 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring the plasma concentrations of metformin and sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) is 
      essential for pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies and therapeutic 
      monitoring. The present work therefore aimed to develop and validate a 
      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of these drugs in human 
      plasma. The analyses were performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system coupled to 
      an Applied Biosystems API 3200 triple quadrupole MS/MS with electrospray 
      ionization in positive ion mode. After one-step protein precipitation of plasma 
      with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid, chromatographic separation was 
      achieved on an Xbridge C(18) column, with a mobile phase consisting of a gradient 
      of water and acetonitrile, both containing 1 mm ammonium formate and 0.1% formic 
      acid. Quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode using m/z 
      130.1 → 71.1 for metformin, m/z 462.0 → 191.2 for canagliflozin, m/z 
      426.1 → 167.1 for dapagliflozin and m/z 468.0 → 354.9 for empagliflozin. The 
      proposed method was validated and demonstrated to be adequate for the 
      quantification of metformin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin for 
      clinical monitoring, pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence studies.

TI  - The SGLT2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin Might Be a New Approach for the Prevention of 
      Acute Kidney Injury.
PG  - 149-157
LID - 10.1159/000498963 [doi]
AB  - Three randomized control trials (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study, 
      Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
      Patients [EMPA-REG OUTCOME], and Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular 
      Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 [DECLARE-TIMI 58]) showed that 
      the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally developed as 
      glucose-lowering drugs, are associated with a lower rate of adverse renal 
      outcomes, such as need for renal replacement therapy, doubling of serum 
      creatinine, and loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to those in 
      placebo groups. Besides, canagliflozin and empagliflozin also showed a lower risk 
      of progression to macroalbuminuria. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and DECLARE-TIMI 
      58 trial also indicated that these SGLT2 inhibitors might have beneficial effects 
      on the prevention of acute kidney injury. The United States Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) warned of the risk of acute kidney injury for canagliflozin 
      and dapagliflozin. We compared canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin 
      with respect to chemical structure and pharmacological properties, to explain the 
      observed differences in preventing acute kidney injury, and put forward the 
      hypotheses of the potential mechanisms of different effects of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      on acute kidney injury. Given the raising clinical use of SGLT2 inhibitors, our 
      review should stimulate further basic science and clinical studies in order to 
      definitively understand the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in acute kidney injury. A 
      weakness of the clinical data obtained so far is the fact that the statements 
      concerning acute kidney injury are just based on safety data - mainly creatine 
      measurements. However, given the mode of action of SGLT2 blockers, initiation of 
      a therapy with a SGLT2 blocker will cause an increase of creatine because of its 
      effects on the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms/glomerular hemodynamics like 
      RAAS blocking agents do. To really understand the potential effects of SGLT2 
      inhibitors, we need preclinical and clinical SGLT2 inhibitor studies focusing on 
      all aspects of acute kidney injury - not just changes in GFR biomarkers.

TI  - Role of Selective Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitors in Managing 
      Cardio-Renal Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Beyond Glycemic Control.
PG  - e17452

LID - e17452
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular complications are the leading 
      causes of death in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Apart from the standard therapy, 
      which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin 
      receptor blockers (ARBs), lipid-lowering medication, and anti-platelet therapy, 
      the new group of drugs termed the 'sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors' have shown promising results in managing complications arising from 
      the cardiovascular and renal systems in diabetics. This article attempts to 
      highlight the role and mechanism of action of this class of drugs.   We reviewed 
      127 articles and analyses of randomized controlled trials using several drugs in 
      the SGLT2 inhibitor family (sotagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, 
      tofogliflozin) over the past five years, out of which 58 met the criteria and aim 
      of the study. These articles were retrieved from PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
      Medline data sources and assessed for quality using the assessment of multiple 
      systematic reviews (AMSTAR) checklist and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Results 
      from the review showed significant benefits in reducing progressive renal 
      decline, blood pressure control, heart failure hospitalization, death from renal 
      or cardiovascular complications, myocardial infarction, and stroke. This benefit 
      is also seen in non-diabetic patients, hence postulating that these effects may 
      not be solely due to glycemic control. There are several mechanisms with which it 
      achieves this benefit with the most significant being its role on intraglomerular 
      pressure. Other pathways include blood pressure control, natriuresis, ventricular 
      remodeling, erythropoiesis, lipid metabolism, plasma volume, and electrolyte 
      imbalance.   It is clear that the role of SGLT2 inhibitors isn't limited to 
      glycemic control and they can achieve a wide array of functions by affecting 
      different systems. More studies need to be done to completely understand this 
      medication to improve the quality of life in diabetic and non-diabetic patients 
      living with CKD and cardiovascular complications. The pharmacokinetics of this 
      drug could also help set the basis for newer medications.

AB  - Saxagliptin and dapagliflozin are individually indicated as an adjunct to diet 
      and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      The bioequivalence of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin 2.5/5 mg and 5/10 mg fixed-dose 
      combination (FDC) tablets compared with coadministration of the individual 
      tablets and the food effect on both strengths of saxagliptin/dapagliflozin FDCs 
      were evaluated in this open-label, randomized, single-dose crossover study. 
      Healthy subjects were randomized to saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 5 mg 
      fasted, 2.5/5 mg FDC fasted, 2.5/5 mg FDC fed (Cohort 1) or saxagliptin 
      5 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg fasted, 5/10 mg FDC fasted, 5/10 mg FDC fed (Cohort 
      2). Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin 
      were obtained predose and up to 60 h postdose. Bioequivalence of FDC tablets 
      versus individual components was concluded if the 90% CIs for FDC to individual 
      component geometric mean ratios of C max, AUC 0-T, and AUC inf of both analytes 
      were between 0.80 and 1.25. Seventy-two subjects were randomized; 71 (98.6%) 
      completed the study. Saxagliptin/dapagliflozin 2.5/5 mg and 5/10 mg FDC tablets 
      were bioequivalent to the individual tablets administered concomitantly. Food had 
      no clinically meaningful effect on saxagliptin or dapagliflozin overall systemic 
      exposure. Saxagliptin/dapagliflozin FDC tablets were bioequivalent to 
      coadministration of the individual components in healthy subjects under fasted 
      conditions and food had no clinically meaningful effect on bioavailability.

TI  - [Dapagliflozin (forxiga®) : SGLT 2 cotransporter inhibitor as glucose-lowering 
      agent in type 2 diabetes].
PG  - 463-469
AB  - Dapagliflozin, a specific inhibitor of sodium-glu¬cose cotransporters type 2 
      (SGLT2, inhibits glucose reabsorp¬tion in renal tubules and thus promotes 
      glucosuria. This effect results in a reduction in fasting and postprandial 
      glycaemia and a decrease of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), with a minor risk of 
      hypoglycaemia, a weight reduction and a reduction in arterial blood pressure. The 
      efficacy of empagliflozin on HbA1c reduction increases according to the level of 
      hyper¬glycaemia but decreases in patients with renal insufficiency. Mycotic 
      genital infections occur more frequently, especially in women, while a negligible 
      increase in mild urinary tract infections may be observed. Dapagliflozin 
      (Forxiga®), 10 mg once daily, is indicated for the treatment of T2DM and 
      reim¬bursed in Belgium with conditions as add-on to a background glucose-lowering 
      therapy (either metformin or sulfonylurea/ repaglinide or metformin plus 
      sulfonylurea/repaglinide or basal insulin plus at least one of these oral 
      glucose-lowering agents). Preliminary results suggest some cardiovascular and 
      renal protection. These results should be confirmed in an ongoing large 
      prospective controlled trial (DECLARE) in type 2 diabetic patients at high 
      cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Magnetic Nanoparticles for the Delivery of Dapagliflozin to Hypoxic Tumors: 
      Physicochemical Characterization and Cell Studies.
PG  - 621-633
LID - 10.1208/s12249-017-0874-2 [doi]
AB  - In solid tumors, hypoxia (lack of oxygen) is developed, which leads to the 
      development of resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy through 
      various mechanisms. Nevertheless, hypoxic cells are particularly vulnerable when 
      glycolysis is inhibited. For this reason, in this study, the development of 
      magnetically targetable nanocarriers of the sodium-glucose transporter protein 
      (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) was developed for the selective delivery 
      of DAPA in tumors. This nanomedicine in combination with radiotherapy or 
      chemotherapy should be useful for effective treatment of hypoxic tumors. The 
      magnetic nanoparticles consisted of a magnetic iron oxide core and a 
      poly(methacrylic acid)-graft-poly(ethyleneglycol methacrylate) (PMAA-g-PEGMA) 
      polymeric shell. The drug (dapagliflozin) molecules were conjugated on the 
      surface of these nanoparticles via in vivo hydrolysable ester bonds. The 
      nanoparticles had an average size of ~ 70 nm and exhibited a DAPA loading 
      capacity 10.75% (w/w) for a theoretical loading 21.68% (w/w). The magnetic 
      responsiveness of the nanoparticles was confirmed with magnetophoresis 
      experiments. The dapagliflozin-loaded magnetic nanoparticles exhibited excellent 
      colloidal stability in aqueous and biological media. Minimal (less than 15% in 
      24 h) drug release from the nanoparticles occurred in physiological pH 7.4; 
      however, drug release was significantly accelerated in pH 5.5. Drug release was 
      also accelerated (triggered) under the influence of an alternating magnetic 
      field. The DAPA-loaded nanoparticles exhibited higher in vitro anticancer 
      activity (cytotoxicity) against A549 human lung cancer cells than free DAPA. The 
      application of an external magnetic field gradient increased the uptake of 
      nanoparticles by cells, leading to increased cytotoxicity. The results justify 
      further in vivo studies of the suitability of DAPA-loaded magnetic nanoparticles 
      for the treatment of hypoxic tumors.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a disease that affects millions of people worldwide and its 
      prevalence is estimated to rise in the future. Billions of dollars are spent each 
      year around the world in health expenditure related to diabetes. There are 
      several anti-diabetic drugs in the market for the treatment of non-insulin 
      dependent diabetes mellitus. In this article, we will be talking about a 
      relatively new class of anti-diabetic drugs called sodium glucose co-transporter 
      2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This class of drugs has a unique mechanism of action 
      focusing on inhibition of glucose reabsorption that separates it from other 
      classes. This article covers the mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the 
      kidneys, the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, several SGLT2 inhibitors 
      currently available in the market as well as those in various phases of 
      development, their individual pharmacokinetics as well as the discussion about 
      the future role of SGLT2 inhibitors, not only for the treatment of diabetes, but 
      also for various other diseases like obesity, hepatic steatosis, and 
      cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Added to Verinurad Plus Febuxostat Further Reduces Serum Uric Acid 
      in Hyperuricemia: The QUARTZ Study.
PG  - e2347-e2356
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa748 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Combining a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor with a xanthine 
      oxidase inhibitor (XOI) and a urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor may enhance 
      serum uric acid (sUA) lowering. However, concerns exist regarding high urinary UA 
      (uUA) excretion rates and subsequent crystallization in renal tubules. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess whether dapagliflozin added to verinurad, a selective URAT1 inhibitor, 
      and febuxostat, an XOI, increases uUA excretion. DESIGN: Randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study (NCT03316131). PATIENTS: Adults with 
      asymptomatic hyperuricemia. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects (N = 36) were randomized to 
      oral once-daily 9 mg verinurad plus 80 mg febuxostat plus 10 mg dapagliflozin for 
      7 days and 7 days of oral once-daily 9 mg verinurad plus 80 mg febuxostat plus 
      placebo with an intervening 7- to 21-day washout period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Difference in peak uUA excretion between groups from baseline to day 7. Secondary 
      outcomes included changes in sUA levels and 24-h uUA excretion. RESULTS: Both 
      regimens lowered mean peak uUA excretion (least squares mean changes from 
      baseline: -12.9 mg/h [95% confidence interval (CI): -21.0 to -4.7], 
      dapagliflozin; -13.2 mg/h [95% CI -21.3 to -5.0], placebo). sUA concentrations 
      were lower with dapagliflozin (mean treatment difference -62.3 µmol/L [95% CI 
      -82.8 to -41.8]). Dapagliflozin did not impact verinurad pharmacokinetics, its 
      main metabolites, or febuxostat or fasting plasma glucose levels vs verinurad 
      plus febuxostat. There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin further reduced sUA without influencing uUA excretion, 
      suggesting that its combination with verinurad and febuxostat at the doses tested 
      does not adversely affect kidney function. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      NCT03316131.

TI  - Exposure-response relationships for the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor 
      dapagliflozin with regard to renal risk markers.
PG  - 916-921
LID - 10.1111/dom.13976 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To quantitate the consistency of an individual's plasma exposure to 
      dapagliflozin upon re-exposure, and to investigate whether the individual's 
      systemic exposure to dapagliflozin explains inter-individual variation in 
      response to dapagliflozin with regard to multiple renal risk markers. METHODS: 
      Data were used from a crossover randomized clinical trial that assessed the 
      albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin in 33 people with type 2 diabetes 
      and elevated albuminuria. Fifteen participants were exposed twice to 
      dapagliflozin. Trough plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin were measured for 
      each participant at steady state. Dapagliflozin plasma concentrations were 
      measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics were simulated based on a population pharmacokinetic model. 
      Linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify the exposure-response 
      relationships. RESULTS: The median plasma concentration after first and second 
      exposure to dapagliflozin was 5.3 ng/mL vs 4.6 ng/mL, respectively (P = 0.78). 
      Lin's concordance correlation coefficient between occasions was 0.73 
      (P < 0.0021). Every 100 ng.h/mL increment in area under the dapagliflozin plasma 
      concentration curve was associated with a decrease in log-transformed urinary 
      albumin:creatinine ratio (β = -5.9, P < 0.01), body weight (β = -0.3, P < 0.01) 
      and estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = -0.7, P = 0.01) and an increase in 
      urinary glucose excretion (β = 17.0, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: An individual's 
      exposure to dapagliflozin is consistent upon re-exposure and correlates with 
      pharmacodynamic response in renal risk markers.

TI  - Pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 
      (SGLT2) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 33-59
LID - 10.1007/s40265-014-0337-y [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a 
      novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several 
      compounds are already available in many countries (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, 
      empagliflozin and ipragliflozin) and some others are in a late phase of 
      development. The available SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic 
      characteristics, with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life 
      allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via 
      glucuronidation to inactive metabolites, the absence of clinically relevant 
      drug-drug interactions and a low renal elimination as parent drug. SGLT2 
      co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of most (90 %) of the glucose 
      filtered by the kidneys. The pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 co-transporters 
      reduces hyperglycaemia by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby 
      increasing urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose excreted in the urine 
      depends on both the level of hyperglycaemia and the glomerular filtration rate. 
      Results of numerous placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials of 12-104 weeks 
      duration have shown significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 
      resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c 
      targets, and a significant lowering of fasting plasma glucose when SGLT2 
      inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in addition to other 
      glucose-lowering therapies including insulin in patients with T2DM. In 
      head-to-head trials of up to 2 years, SGLT2 inhibitors exerted similar 
      glucose-lowering activity to metformin, sulphonylureas or sitagliptin. The 
      durability of the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be 
      better; however, this remains to be more extensively investigated. The risk of 
      hypoglycaemia was much lower with SGLT2 inhibitors than with sulphonylureas and 
      was similarly low as that reported with metformin, pioglitazone or sitagliptin. 
      Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to 
      reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and 
      they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other oral 
      glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors 
      declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing 
      information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage 
      adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is 
      also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal 
      impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of 
      hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall 
      effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and 
      will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with 
      cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and 
      their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve more 
      attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most frequently 
      reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while urinary 
      tract infections are less commonly observed and generally benign. In conclusion, 
      with their unique mechanism of action that is independent of insulin secretion 
      and action, SGLT2 inhibitors are a useful addition to the therapeutic options 
      available for the management of T2DM at any stage in the natural history of the 
      disease. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have already been extensively investigated, 
      further studies should even better delineate the best place of these new 
      glucose-lowering agents in the already rich armamentarium for the management of 
      T2DM.

AB  - The sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) is a low-affinity transport system 
      that is specifically expressed in the kidney and plays an important role in renal 
      glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Competitive inhibition of SGLT2 
      therefore represents an innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of 
      hyperglycaemia and/or obesity in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes by 
      enhancing glucose and energy loss through the urine. The observation that 
      individuals with familial renal glycosuria maintain normal long-term kidney 
      function provides some reassurance that this mode of action will not adversely 
      affect renal function. Intense research in this therapeutic area has led to the 
      discovery of novel SGLT2 inhibitors, each with different chemical, 
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. This review outlines the biology, 
      expression and pleotropic activity of the SGLT system and the pharmacological 
      profile of SGLT2 inhibitors and provides a summary of preclinical and limited 
      clinical data available to characterize the efficacy, safety and potential 
      clinical utility of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of diabetes.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current options for glycemic control are less than optimal in 
      terms of efficacy and to reduce complications in the diabetic population. 
      Selective inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal tubule increases urinary glucose 
      excretion thereby reducing plasma glucose levels, which may present a novel 
      therapeutic approach. RECENT FINDINGS: SGLT2 inhibitors enhance glucose excretion 
      and improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the absence of 
      clinically relevant hypoglycemia or sustained changes in volume status or 
      glomerular filtration rate. This is associated with lowering of body weight and 
      may reduce systolic blood pressure. The increased glucosuria appears to increase 
      the risk of genital infections but may not increase the risk of urinary tract 
      infections. SUMMARY: The ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce plasma glucose 
      without inducing increased insulin secretion, clinically relevant hypoglycemia, 
      or weight gain constitutes a major advance. The ability to increase glucose 
      excretion provides a powerful means to treat caloric excess conditions. Important 
      questions remain to be resolved and more clinical research is needed on the 
      long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibition. Potential extrarenal effects need to be 
      explored in order to determine the safety of these compounds. It also remains to 
      be determined whether these drugs lower the toxicity of glucose directly on renal 
      cells, independent of hyperglycemia, which may slow or prevent the progressive 
      nature of diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in drug-naive Asian patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: a randomized, blinded, prospective phase III study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dapagliflozin is a highly selective, orally active inhibitor of renal 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 that reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary 
      glucose excretion. The goal of this study was to evaluate dapagliflozin as 
      monotherapy in drug-naive Asian patients with type 2 diabetes whose disease was 
      inadequately controlled with diet and exercise. METHODS: In this Phase III, 
      multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind study, drug-naive patients with 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ≥7.0% to ≤10.5% (≥53-≤91 mmol/mol) were 
      randomized (by using an interactive voice response system) to receive placebo (n 
      = 132), dapagliflozin 5 mg (n = 128), or dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 133). The 
      primary end point was mean change from baseline in HbA1c level at week 24 
      (last-observation-carried-forward). Secondary end points included changes in 
      fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, body weight, and other 
      glycemic parameters. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced across 
      groups. Most patients (89%) were Chinese, median disease duration was 0.2 year, 
      and mean HbA1c level was 8.26%. Most patients (87%) completed the study. At week 
      24, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.29% for placebo versus -1.04% and -1.11% for 
      dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both doses). Changes in 
      fasting plasma glucose were 2.5, -25.1, and -31.6 mg/dL (0.14, -1.39, and -1.75 
      mmol/L) for placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg. Changes in 
      2-hour postprandial glucose were 1.1, -46.8, and -54.9 mg/dL (0.06, -2.60, and 
      -3.05 mmol/L). Reductions in body weight were -0.27, -1.64, and -2.25 kg. 
      Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) were 21.3%, 
      42.6%, and 49.8%. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 63.6%, 61.7%, and 60.9% of 
      patients, and serious AEs occurred in 1.5%, 3.9%, and 3.0% of patients. No deaths 
      occurred. Hypoglycemia was uncommon (1.5%, 0.8%, and 0.8%); no hypoglycemic event 
      led to discontinuation. Genital infections occurred in 0.8%, 3.1%, and 4.5% of 
      patients and urinary tract infections in 3.0%, 3.9%, and 5.3% of patients. No AEs 
      of renal infection or pyelonephritis were reported. No changes in renal function 
      or AEs of renal failure occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, 
      dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg demonstrated clinically and statistically significant 
      improvements in HbA1c levels after 24 weeks of treatment. Dose-dependent, 
      statistically significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, postprandial 
      glucose, and weight were also observed for both doses compared with placebo. AEs 
      and serious AEs were balanced across groups, with low rates of hypoglycemia and 
      no increase in renal events. Genital infections and urinary tract infections were 
      more common with dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in these drug-naive 
      Asian patients was well tolerated, significantly improving glycemic control with 
      the additional benefit of weight loss.

TI  - Evaluation of renal and cardiovascular protection mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors: 
      model-based analysis of clinical data.
PG  - F1295-F1306
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00202.2018 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms of cardiovascular and renal protection observed in clinical trials 
      of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) are incompletely 
      understood and likely multifactorial, including natriuretic, diuretic, and 
      antihypertensive effects, glomerular pressure reduction, and lowering of plasma 
      and interstitial fluid volume. To quantitatively evaluate the contribution of 
      proposed SGLT2i mechanisms of action on changes in renal hemodynamics and volume 
      status, we coupled a mathematical model of renal function and volume homeostasis 
      with clinical data in healthy subjects administered 10 mg of dapagliflozin once 
      daily. The minimum set of mechanisms necessary to reproduce observed clinical 
      responses (urinary sodium and water excretion, serum creatinine and sodium) was 
      determined, and important unobserved physiological variables (glomerular 
      pressure, blood and interstitial fluid volume) were then simulated. We further 
      simulated the response to SGLT2i in diabetic virtual patients with and without 
      renal impairment. Multiple mechanisms were required to explain the observed 
      response: 1) direct inhibition of sodium and glucose reabsorption through SGLT2, 
      2) SGLT2-driven inhibition of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 sodium reabsorption, and 3) 
      osmotic diuresis coupled with peripheral sodium storage. The model also showed 
      that the consequences of these mechanisms include lowering of glomerular 
      pressure, reduction of blood and interstitial fluid volume, and mild blood 
      pressure reduction, in agreement with clinical observations. The simulations 
      suggest that these effects are more significant in diabetic patients than healthy 
      subjects and that while glucose excretion may diminish with renal impairment, 
      improvements in glomerular pressure and blood volume are not diminished at lower 
      glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2i may be 
      sustained in renally impaired patients.

      diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 295-304
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0128-8 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) reduce hyperglycaemia 
      by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby increasing urinary glucose 
      excretion. They are proposed as a novel approach for the management of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus. They have proven their efficacy in reducing glycated 
      haemoglobin, without inducing hypoglycaemia, as monotherapy or in combination 
      with various other glucose-lowering agents, with the add-on value of promoting 
      some weight loss and lowering arterial blood pressure. As they may be used 
      concomitantly with many other drugs, we review the potential drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) regarding the three leaders in the class (dapagliglozin, 
      canagliflozin and empagliflozin). Most of the available studies were performed in 
      healthy volunteers and have assessed the pharmacokinetic interferences with a 
      single administration of the SGLT2 inhibitor. The exposure [assessed by peak 
      plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)] 
      to each SGLT2 inhibitor tested was not significantly influenced by the 
      concomitant administration of other glucose-lowering agents or cardiovascular 
      agents commonly used in patients with type 2 diabetes. Reciprocally, these 
      medications did not influence the pharmacokinetic parameters of dapagliflozin, 
      canagliflozin or empagliflozin. Some modest changes were not considered as 
      clinically relevant. However, drugs that could specifically interfere with the 
      metabolic pathways of SGLT2 inhibitors [rifampicin, inhibitors or inducers of 
      uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)] may result in significant 
      changes in the exposure of SGLT2 inhibitors, as shown for dapagliflozin and 
      canagliflozin. Potential DDIs in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving chronic 
      treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor deserve further attention, especially in 
      individuals treated with several medications or in more fragile patients with 
      hepatic and/or renal impairment.

AB  - Dapagliflozin (DAP) is a potent and selective sodium-glucose contransporter-2 
      inhibitor, for treating type 2 diabetes. DAP propanediol monohydrate 
      (DAP-PDO-H(2)O, 1:1:1) is the solid form used in the current tablet product to 
      address the severe hygroscopicity problem of DAP free form. DAP-PDO-H(2)O, 
      however, suffers the problem of instability when exposed to high temperature, 
      which renders it amorphous. In this work, we report on the preparation and 
      evaluation of a new 1:1 cocrystal between DAP and citric acid (DAP-CA). The 
      DAP-CA cocrystal exhibits superior stability against high temperature and high 
      relative humidity without compromising dissolution and tableting performance. 
      Thus, DAP-CA is a promising solid form for developing the next generation DAP 
      tablet products with improved performance.

AB  - Optimization of extraction and chromatographic conditions is essential for the 
      simultaneous analysis of drugs having different physico-chemical properties, 
      especially for in vivo applications. The present work describes concurrent 
      estimation of metformin (MET) and three sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibitors namely canagliflozin (CANA), dapagliflozin (DAPA) and empagliflozin 
      (EMPA) in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS). Sample clean-up was optimized using ion-pair solid-phase extraction 
      with sodium lauryl sulphate on Strata-X extraction cartridges. Consistent 
      recoveries were obtained by critically optimizing parameters such as washing and 
      elution solvents during extraction. The extraction recovery ranged from 79 to 88% 
      for all the analytes. Chromatographic separation were accomplished on a Cyano 
      (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column within 5.0 min using acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium 
      formate buffer (75:25, v/v) as the mobile phase. The resolution factors between 
      MET-EMPA, MET-DAPA, MET-CANA, DAPA-EMPA and CANA-DAPA were 4.92, 5.85, 7.13, 1.01 
      and 1.44, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range 
      of 2.00-2000, 3.00-3000, 0.20-200 and 1.50-1500 ng/mL for MET, CANA, DAPA and 
      EMPA, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a polarity 
      switching approach to achieve high sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring 
      mode. The method was validated using current regulatory guidelines and applied to 
      study the pharmacokinetics of fixed-dose formulations of MET and SGLT-2 
      inhibitors in healthy subjects.

TI  - Exploring the potential of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in type 1 diabetes: 
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
PG  - 412-9
LID - 10.2337/dc13-2955 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin adjustments to maintain glycemic control in individuals with 
      type 1 diabetes often lead to wide glucose fluctuations, hypoglycemia, and 
      increased body weight. Dapagliflozin, an insulin-independent sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increases glucosuria and reduces hyperglycemia 
      in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of this study was to 
      assess short-term safety of dapagliflozin in combination with insulin; secondary 
      objectives included pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy parameters. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 2-week, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study randomly assigned 70 adults with type 1 
      diabetes (HbA1c 7-10%), who were receiving treatment with stable doses of 
      insulin, to one of four dapagliflozin doses (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo. The 
      insulin dose was not proactively reduced at randomization but could be adjusted 
      for safety reasons. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (88.6%) completed the study. Any 
      hypoglycemia was common across all treatments (60.0-92.3%); one major event of 
      hypoglycemia occurred with dapagliflozin 10 mg. No diabetic ketoacidosis 
      occurred. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes. Glucosuria increased by 88 g/24 h (95% CI 55 to 121) with 
      dapagliflozin 10 mg and decreased by -21.5 g/24 h (95% CI -53.9 to 11.0) with 
      placebo. Changes from baseline with dapagliflozin 10 mg by day 7 were as follows: 
      -2.29 mmol/L (95% CI -3.71 to -0.87 [-41.3 mg/dL; 95% CI -66.9 to -15.7]) for 
      24-h daily average blood glucose; -3.77 mmol/L (95% CI -6.09 to -1.45 [-63.1 
      mg/dL; 95% CI -111.5 to -14.8]) for mean amplitude of glycemic excursion; and 
      -16.2% (95% CI -29.4 to -0.5) for mean percent change in total daily insulin 
      dose. Corresponding changes with placebo were as follows: -1.13 mmol/L (95% CI 
      -3.63 to 1.37), -0.45 mmol/L (95% CI -4.98 to 4.08), and 1.7% (95% CI -22.8 to 
      33.9), respectively. However, for every efficacy parameter, the 95% CIs for all 
      dapagliflozin doses overlapped those for placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory 
      study of dapagliflozin in adults with type 1 diabetes demonstrated acceptable 
      short-term tolerability and expected pharmacokinetic profiles and increases in 
      urinary glucose excretion. Within the dapagliflozin groups, dose-related 
      reductions in 24-h glucose, glycemic variability, and insulin dose were 
      suggested, which provide hope that SGLT2 inhibition may prove in larger 
      randomized controlled trials to be efficacious in reducing hyperglycemia in type 
      1 diabetes.

TI  - Common UGT1A9 polymorphisms do not have a clinically meaningful impact on the 
      apparent oral clearance of dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1942-1946
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15117 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of human renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
      (SGLT2), first approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      Dapagliflozin is primarily metabolized by uridine diphosphate 
      glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9). The effect of UGT1A9 polymorphisms on 
      dapagliflozin apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was studied with dapagliflozin 
      population pharmacokinetic data and UGT1A9 genotype data (I.399C>T, rs2011404, 
      rs6759892, rs7577677, rs4148323, UGT1A9*2 and UGT1A9*3) from a Phase 2 study 
      conducted in subjects with T2DM (n = 187). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
      model accounting for known covariates influencing dapagliflozin CL/F was applied 
      to these data to quantify the impact of each UGT1A9 polymorphism relative to the 
      wildtype UGT1A9 genotype. The analysis showed that the geometric mean ratios of 
      dapagliflozin CL/F for all of the UGT1A9 polymorphisms studied were within the 
      range of wildtype UGT1A9 CL/F values. Consequently, the polymorphisms of UGT1A9 
      studied had no clinically meaningful impact on the CL/F of dapagliflozin.

AB  - Dapagliflozin, a first-in-class, selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), promotes urinary glucose excretion to reduce 
      hyperglycemia for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. A series of nonclinical 
      studies were undertaken to evaluate dapagliflozin in species where it was shown 
      to have pharmacologic activity comparable with that in humans at doses that 
      resulted in supratherapeutic exposures. In vitro screening (>300 targets; 10 
      μmol/L) indicated no significant off-target activities for dapagliflozin or its 
      primary human metabolite. Once daily, orally administered dapagliflozin was 
      evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats (≤6 months) and in beagle dogs (≤1 year) at 
      exposures >5000-fold those observed at the maximum recommended human clinical 
      dose (MRHD; 10 mg). Anticipated, pharmacologically mediated effects of 
      glucosuria, osmotic diuresis, and mild electrolyte loss were observed, but there 
      were no adverse effects at clinically relevant exposures, including in the 
      kidneys or urogenital tract. The SGLT2-/- mice, which show chronic glucosuria, 
      and dapagliflozin-treated, wild-type mice exhibited similar safety profiles. In 
      rats but not dogs, dapagliflozin at >2000-fold MRHD exposures resulted in tissue 
      mineralization and trabecular bone accretion. Investigative studies suggested 
      that the effect was not relevant to human safety, since it was partially related 
      to off-target inhibition of SGLT1, which was observed only at high doses of 
      dapagliflozin and resulted in intestinal glucose malabsorption and increased 
      intestinal calcium absorption. The rigorous assessment of supra- and off-target 
      dapagliflozin pharmacology in nonclinical species allowed for a thorough 
      evaluation of potential toxicity, providing us with confidence in its safety in 
      patients with diabetes.

TI  - Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of the Drug-Drug Interaction of

      Inhibitor Mefenamic Acid.
PG  - 127-136

AB  - The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ertugliflozin is metabolized by the 
      uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes UGT1A9 and 
      UGT2B4/2B7. This analysis evaluated the drug-drug interaction (DDI) following 
      co-administration of ertugliflozin with the UGT inhibitor mefenamic acid (MFA) 
      using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. The ertugliflozin 
      modeling assumptions and parameters were verified using clinical data from 
      single-dose and multiple-dose studies of ertugliflozin in healthy volunteers, and 
      the PBPK fraction metabolized assignments were consistent with human absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion results. The model for MFA was developed 
      using clinical data, and in vivo UGT inhibitory constant values were estimated 
      using the results from a clinical DDI study with MFA and dapagliflozin, a UGT1A9 
      and UGT2B4/2B7 substrate in the same chemical class as ertugliflozin. Using the 
      verified compound files, PBPK modeling predicted an ertugliflozin ratio of area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(R) ) of 1.51 when co-administered 
      with MFA. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00989079.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (canagliflozin, 
      dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) are new glucose-lowering agents that exert their 
      therapeutic activity independently of insulin by facilitating glucose excretion 
      through the kidneys. However, this simple renal mechanism that results in 
      sustained glucose urinary loss leads to more complex indirect metabolic effects. 
      First, by reduction of chronic hyperglycaemia and attenuation of glucose 
      toxicity, SGLT-2 inhibitors can improve both insulin secretion by beta cells and 
      peripheraltissue insulin sensitivity. In the case of canagliflozin, because of 
      low-potency SGLT1 inhibition, a non-renal (intestinal) effect may also be 
      considered, which may contribute to better control of postprandial 
      hyperglycaemia, although this contribution remains to be better analyzed in 
      humans. Second, chronic glucose loss most probably leads to compensatory 
      mechanisms. One of them, although not well evidenced in humans, might involve an 
      increase in energy intake, an effect that may limit weight loss in the long run. 
      Another could be an increase in endogenous glucose production, most probably 
      driven by increased glucagon secretion, which may somewhat attenuate the 
      glucoselowering effect. Nevertheless, despite these compensatory mechanisms and 
      most probably because of the positive effects of the reduction in glucotoxicity, 
      SGLT-2 inhibitors exert clinically relevant glucose-lowering activity while 
      promoting weight loss, a unique dual effect among oral antidiabetic agents. 
      Furthermore, the combination of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that either 
      have anorectic effects (such as incretin-based therapies) or reduce hepatic 
      glucose output (like metformin) and, thus, may dampen these two compensatory 
      mechanisms appears appealing for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Classical risk assessment models for setting safe occupational exposure limits 
      (OEL) have used multiple uncertainty factors (UF) applied to a point of departure 
      (POD), e.g., a No Observed Effect Level (NOEL), which in some cases is the 
      pharmacological effect. Dapagliflozin promotes glucosuria by inhibiting the renal 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 transporter. The initial OEL for dapagliflozin 
      (0.002mg/m(3)) was calculated when low dose clinical data was not available to 
      identify a NOEL resulting in the need to use excessive UFs. To reduce the UFs 
      from the OEL, a clinical pharmacodynamic [glucosuria and urinary glucose dipstick 
      (UGD)] and pharmacokinetic study was conducted with single oral doses of 0.001, 
      0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 or 2.5mg administered to 36 healthy subjects. Dose-related 
      dapagliflozin systemic exposures were observed at doses ⩾0.1mg and glucosuria was 
      observed at doses ⩾0.3mg and corroborated by UGD. The NOEL was therefore 0.1mg 
      for glucosuria. For setting the new OEL, no UFs were required. Dividing the POD 
      by 10m(3) (the volume of air an adult inhales in a workday), the resulting OEL 
      was 0.01mg/m(3). In conclusion, low-dose clinical pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic data can allow the OEL to be adjusted to the highest safe level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of Sodium-Glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
      had rewritten the treatment of diabetes mellitus with an impressive fall in the 
      incidence of death and associated complications. INTRODUCTION: The SGLT2 
      inhibitors by inhibiting the SGLT2 in the proximal nephron, helps in reducing the 
      reabsorption of approximately 90% of the filtered glucose and increased urinary 
      glucose excretion (UGE). METHODS: The literature related to SGLT2 inhibitors has 
      been thoroughly explored from various available public domains and reviewed 
      extensively for this article. Detailed and updated information related to SGLT2 
      inhibitors with a major focus on the recently approved Ertuglifolzin is 
      structured in this review. RESULT: The present review is an effort to understand 
      the management of diabetes mellitus over the past few decades with a special 
      focus on the role of SGLT2 receptor in the causes of therapeutic and preventive 
      strategies for diabetes mellitus. Pragmatic placement of the currently available 
      Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, and Empagliflozin as oral antidiabetic agents has 
      been done. Well accommodated stereochemistry and a high docking score of 
      Ertugliflozin in ligand-receptor simulation studies attribute to its high 
      potency. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the unique mechanism of SGLT2 
      Inhibitors coupled with pleiotropic benefits on weight and blood pressure, which 
      make it an attractive choice of therapy to diabetic patients, not controlled by 
      other medications.

TI  - Characterization of the transport activity of SGLT2/MAP17, the renal low-affinity 
      Na(+)-glucose cotransporter.
PG  - F467-F474
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00628.2016 [doi]
AB  - The cotransporter SGLT2 is responsible for 90% of renal glucose reabsorption, and 
      we recently showed that MAP17 appears to work as a required β-subunit. We report 
      in the present study a detailed functional characterization of human SGLT2 in 
      coexpression with human MAP17 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Addition of external 
      glucose generates a large inward current in the presence of Na, confirming an 
      electrogenic transport mechanism. At a membrane potential of -50 mV, SGLT2 
      affinity constants for glucose and Na are 3.4 ± 0.4 and 18 ± 6 mM, respectively. 
      The change in the reversal potential of the cotransport current as a function of 
      external glucose concentration clearly confirms a 1:1 Na-to-glucose transport 
      stoichiometry. SGLT2 is selective for glucose and α-methylglucose but also 
      transports, to a lesser extent, galactose and 3-O-methylglucose. SGLT2 can be 
      inhibited in a competitive manner by phlorizin (K(i) = 31 ± 4 nM) and by 
      dapagliflozin (K(i) = 0.75 ± 0.3 nM). Similarly to SGLT1, SGLT2 can be activated 
      by Na, Li, and protons. Pre-steady-state currents for SGLT2 do exist but are 
      small in amplitude and relatively fast (a time constant of ~2 ms). The leak 
      current defined as the phlorizin-sensitive current in the absence of substrate 
      was extremely small in the case of SGLT2. In summary, in comparison with SGLT1, 
      SGLT2 has a lower affinity for glucose, a transport stoichiometry of 1:1, very 
      small pre-steady-state and leak currents, a 10-fold higher affinity for 
      phlorizin, and an affinity for dapagliflozin in the subnanomolar range.

TI  - Dapagliflozin, a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, induces dose-dependent glucosuria in 
      healthy subjects.
PG  - 520-6
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2008.251 [doi]
AB  - Dapagliflozin selectively inhibits renal glucose reabsorption by inhibiting 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2). It was developed as an 
      insulin-independent treatment approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the drug were 
      evaluated in single-ascending-dose (SAD; 2.5-500 mg) and multiple-ascending-dose 
      (MAD; 2.5-100 mg daily for 14 days) studies in healthy subjects. Dapagliflozin 
      exhibited dose-proportional plasma concentrations with a half-life of 
      approximately 17 h. The amount of glucosuria was also dose-dependent. Cumulative 
      amounts of glucose excreted on day 1, relating to doses from 2.5-100 mg (MAD), 
      ranged from 18 to 62 g; day 14 values were comparable to day 1 values, with no 
      apparent changes in glycemic parameters. Doses of approximately 20-50 mg provided 
      close-to-maximal SGLT2 inhibition for at least 24 h. Dapagliflozin demonstrates 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and dose-dependent glucosuria that are 
      sustained over 24 h, which indicates that it is suitable for administration in 
      once-daily doses and suggests that further investigation of its efficacy in T2DM 
      patients is warranted.

TI  - Intestinal electrogenic sodium-dependent glucose absorption in tilapia and trout 
      reveal species differences in SLC5A-associated kinetic segmental segregation.
PG  - R222-R234
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00304.2018 [doi]
AB  - Electrogenic sodium-dependent glucose transport along the length of the intestine 
      was compared between the omnivorous Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus) and the 
      carnivorous rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Ussing chambers. In tilapia, 
      a high-affinity, high-capacity kinetic system accounted for the transport 
      throughout the proximal intestine, midintestine, and hindgut segments. Similar 
      dapagliflozin and phloridzin dihydrate inhibition across all segments support 
      this homogenous high-affinity, high-capacity system throughout the tilapia 
      intestine. Genomic and gene expression analysis supported findings by identifying 
      10 of the known 12 SLC5A family members, with homogeneous expression throughout 
      the segments with dominant expression of sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1; 
      SLC5A1) and sodium-myoinositol cotransporter 2 (SMIT2; SLC5A11). In contrast, 
      trout's electrogenic sodium-dependent glucose absorption was 20-35 times lower 
      and segregated into three significantly different kinetic systems found in 
      different anatomical segments: a high-affinity, low-capacity system in the 
      pyloric ceca; a super-high-affinity, low-capacity system in the midgut; and a 
      low-affinity, low-capacity system in the hindgut. Genomic and gene expression 
      analysis found 5 of the known 12 SLC5A family members with dominant expression of 
      SGLT1 ( SLC5A1), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2; SLC5A2), and SMIT2 ( 
      SLC5A11) in the pyloric ceca, and only SGLT1 ( SLC5A1) in the midgut, accounting 
      for differences in kinetics between the two. The hindgut presented a 
      low-affinity, low-capacity system partially attributed to a decrease in SGLT1 ( 
      SLC5A1). Overall, the omnivorous tilapia had a higher electrogenic glucose 
      absorption than the carnivorous trout, represented with different kinetic systems 
      and a greater expression and number of SLC5A orthologs. Fish differ from mammals, 
      having hindgut electrogenic glucose absorption and segment specific transport 
      kinetics.

AB  - Kinetic characterization of electrogenic sodium-dependent transport in Ussing 
      chambers of d-glucose and d-galactose demonstrated sigmoidal/Hill kinetics in the 
      porcine jejunum and ileum, with the absence of transport in the distal colon. In 
      the jejunum, a high-affinity, super-low-capacity (Ha/sLc) kinetic system 
      accounted for glucose transport, and a low-affinity, low-capacity (La/Lc) kinetic 
      system accounted for galactose transport. In contrast, the ileum demonstrated a 
      high-affinity, super-high-capacity (Ha/sHc) glucose transport and a low-affinity, 
      high-capacity (La/Hc) galactose transport systems. Jejunal glucose transport was 
      not inhibited by dapagliflozin, but galactose transport was inhibited. 
      Comparatively, ileal glucose and galactose transport were both sensitive to 
      dapagliflozin. Genomic and gene expression analyses identified 10 of the 12 known 
      SLC5A family members in the porcine jejunum, ileum, and distal colon. Dominant 
      SGLT1 (SLC5A1) and SGLT3 (SLC5A4) expression was associated with the sigmoidal 
      Ha/sLc glucose and La/Lc galactose transport systems in the jejunum. 
      Comparatively, the dominant expression of SGLT1 (SLC5A1) in the ileum was only 
      associated with Ha glucose and La galactose kinetic systems. However, the 
      sigmoidal kinetics and overall high capacity (Hc) of transport is unlikely 
      accounted for by SGLT1 (SLC5A1) alone. Finally, the absence of transport and lack 
      of pharmacological inhibition in the colon was associated with the poor 
      expression of SLC5A genes. Altogether, the results demonstrated intestinal 
      segregation of monosaccharide transport fit different sigmoidal kinetic systems. 
      This reveals multiple transporter populations in each system, supported by gene 
      expression profiles and pharmacological inhibition. Overall, this work 
      demonstrates a complexity to transporter involvement in intestinal electrogenic 
      monosaccharide absorption systems not previously defined.

AB  - Previously we investigated the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and 
      pharmacologic properties of all six sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 
      inhibitors commercially available in Japan using normal and diabetic mice. We 
      classified the SGLT2 inhibitors with respect to duration of action as either 
      long-acting (ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin) or intermediate-acting 
      (tofogliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and luseogliflozin). In the present 
      study, antidiabetic effects of repeated administration of these SGLT2 inhibitors 
      in type 2 diabetic mice were investigated. When repeatedly administered for 4 
      weeks, all SGLT2 inhibitors significantly exhibited antihyperglycemic, 
      antihyperinsulinemic, and pancreas-protective effects, as well as insulin 
      resistance-improving effects. When compared at doses producing comparable 
      reduction in hyperglycemia across all drugs, the antidiabetic effects of 
      ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin were more potent than those of the other four 
      drugs, but these differences among the six drugs were not statistically 
      significant. Further, an oral glucose tolerance test performed after repeated 
      administration demonstrated significant improvement in glucose tolerance only 
      with ipragliflozin and dapagliflozin, implying improved insulin resistance and 
      secretion. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, although all SGLT2 
      inhibitors exert antidiabetic effects in type 2 diabetic mice, these 
      pharmacologic effects might be slightly superior with the long-acting drugs, 
      which are able to provide favorable blood glucose control throughout the day.

TI  - Development of a Robust Control Strategy for Fixed-Dose Combination Bilayer 
      Tablets with Integrated Quality by Design, Statistical, and Process Analytical 
      Technology Approach.

AB  - Control strategy and quality by design (QbD) are widely used to develop 
      pharmaceutical products and improve drug quality; however, studies on fixed-dose 
      combination (FDC) bilayer tablets are limited. In this study, the bilayer tablet 
      consisted of high-dose metformin HCl in a sustained-release layer and low-dose 
      dapagliflozin l-proline in an immediate-release layer. The formulation and 
      process of each layer were optimized using the QbD approach. A d-optimal mixture 
      design and response surface design were applied to optimize critical material 
      attributes and critical process parameters, respectively. The robust design space 
      was developed using Monte Carlo simulations by evaluating the risk of uncertainty 
      in the model predictions. Multivariate analysis showed that there were 
      significant correlations among impeller speed, massing time, granule bulk 
      density, and dissolution in the metformin HCl layer, and among roller pressure, 
      ribbon density, and dissolution in the dapagliflozin l-proline layer. Process 
      analytical technology (PAT) was used with in-line transmittance near-infrared 
      spectroscopy to confirm the bulk and ribbon densities of the optimized bilayer 
      tablet. Moreover, the in vitro drug release and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies 
      showed that the optimized test drug was bioequivalent to the reference drug. This 
      study suggested that integrated QbD, statistical, and PAT approaches can develop 
      a robust control strategy for FDC bilayer tablets by implementing real-time 
      release testing based on the relationships among various variables.

TI  - Pharmacological evaluation of HM41322, a novel SGLT1/2 dual inhibitor, in vitro 
      and in vivo.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.4196/kjpp.2019.23.1.55 [doi]
AB  - HM41322 is a novel oral sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1/2 dual inhibitor. 
      In this study, the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic 
      profiles of HM41322 were compared to those of dapagliflozin. HM41322 showed a 
      10-fold selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1. HM41322 showed an inhibitory effect on 
      SGLT2 similar to dapagliflozin, but showed a more potent inhibitory effect on 
      SGLT1 than dapagliflozin. The maximum plasma HM41322 level after single oral 
      doses at 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg were 142, 439, and 1830 ng/ml, respectively, and the 
      T(1/2) was 3.1 h. HM41322 was rapidly absorbed and reached the circulation within 
      15 min. HM41322 maximized urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting both SGLT1 and 
      SGLT2 in the kidney. HM41322 3 mg/kg caused the maximum urinary glucose excretion 
      in normoglycemic mice (19.32±1.16 mg/g) at 24 h. In normal and diabetic mice, 
      HM41322 significantly reduced glucose excursion. Four-week administration of 
      HM41322 in db/db mice reduced HbA1c in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, 
      HM41322 showed a favorable preclinical profile of postprandial glucose control 
      through dual inhibitory activities against SGLT1 and SGLT2.

TI  - Design of FLAIR: a Phase 2b Study of the 5-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein 
      Inhibitor AZD5718 in Patients With Proteinuric CKD.
PG  - 2803-2810
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2021.08.018 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain at risk for 
      kidney and cardiovascular events resulting from residual albuminuria, despite 
      available treatments. Leukotrienes are proinflammatory and vasoconstrictive lipid 
      mediators implicated in the etiology of chronic inflammatory diseases. AZD5718 is 
      a potent, selective, and reversible 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) 
      inhibitor that suppresses leukotriene production. METHODS: FLAIR (FLAP Inhibition 
      in Renal disease) is an ongoing phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      AZD5718 in patients with proteinuric CKD with or without type 2 diabetes. 
      Participants receive AZD5718 at 3 different doses or placebo once daily for 12 
      weeks, followed by an 8-week extension in which they also receive dapagliflozin 
      (10 mg/d) as anticipated future standard of care. The planned sample size is 632 
      participants, providing 91% power to detect 30% reduction in urinary 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) between the maximum dose of AZD5718 and 
      placebo. The dose-response effect of AZD5718 on UACR after the dapagliflozin 
      extension is the primary efficacy objective. Key secondary objectives are the 
      dose-response effect of AZD5718 plus current standard of care on UACR and acute 
      effects of treatment on the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Safety, 
      tolerability, AZD5718 pharmacokinetics, and analyses of biomarkers that may 
      predict or reflect response to AZD5718 are additional objectives. CONCLUSION: 
      FLAIR will provide data on the effects of 5-lipoxygenase pathway inhibition in 
      patients with proteinuric CKD with or without type 2 diabetes, and will form the 
      basis for future clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04492722).

AB  - Combination therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is necessary to achieve tight 
      glycaemic control and reduce complication risk. Current treatment plans require 
      patients to take several drugs concomitantly leading to low therapy adherence. 
      This study describes the development and characterisation of a stable parenteral 
      co-formulation of a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) and 
      a therapeutic lipidated peptide, using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as an 
      enabling excipient. Using NMR, calorimetry, computational modelling and 
      spectroscopic methods, we show that besides increasing the solubility of 
      dapagliflozin, cyclodextrin prevents self-association of the peptide through 
      interaction with the lipid chain and amino acids prone to aggregation including 
      aromatic groups and ionisable residues. While those interactions cause a dramatic 
      secondary structure change, no impact on potency was seen in vitro. A 
      subcutaneous administration of the co-formulation in rat showed that both drugs 
      reach exposure levels previously shown to be efficacious in clinical mono-therapy 
      studies. Interestingly, a faster absorption rate was observed for the peptide 
      formulated within the cyclodextrin vehicle with respect to the buffer vehicle, 
      which could trigger an earlier onset of action. The cyclodextrin based 
      co-formulation is therefore a promising approach to develop a fixed dose 
      combination of a therapeutic peptide and a small molecule drug for increased 
      patient adherence and better blood glucose control.

TI  - Applied physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to assess uridine 
      diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-mediated drug-drug interactions for 
      Vericiguat.
PG  - 79-92
LID - 10.1002/psp4.13059 [doi]
AB  - Vericiguat (Verquvo; US: Merck, other countries: Bayer) is a novel drug for the 
      treatment of chronic heart failure. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that 
      the primary route of metabolism for vericiguat is glucuronidation, mainly 
      catalyzed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 and to a lesser 
      extent UGT1A1. Whereas a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of the UGT1A9 
      inhibitor mefenamic acid showed a 20% exposure increase, the effect of UGT1A1 
      inhibitors has not been assessed clinically. This modeling study describes a 
      physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) approach to complement the clinical 
      DDI liability assessment and support prescription labeling. A PBPK model of 
      vericiguat was developed based on in vitro and clinical data, verified against 
      data from the mefenamic acid DDI study, and applied to assess the UGT1A1 DDI 
      liability by running an in silico DDI study with the UGT1A1 inhibitor atazanavir. 
      A minor effect with an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio 
      of 1.12 and a peak plasma concentration ratio of 1.04 was predicted, which 
      indicates that there is no clinically relevant DDI interaction anticipated. 
      Additionally, the effect of potential genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 
      was evaluated, which showed that an average modest increase of up to 1.7-fold in 
      AUC may be expected in the case of concomitantly reduced UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 
      activity for subpopulations expressing non-wild-type variants for both isoforms. 
      This study is a first cornerstone to qualify the PK-Sim platform for use of 
      UGT-mediated DDI predictions, including PBPK models of perpetrators, such as 
      mefenamic acid and atazanavir, and sensitive UGT substrates, such as 
      dapagliflozin and raltegravir.

TI  - Discovery of ACH-000143: A Novel Potent and Peripherally Preferred Melatonin 
      Receptor Agonist that Reduces Liver Triglycerides and Steatosis in Diet-Induced 
      Obese Rats.
PG  - 1904-1929

AB  - The modulation of melatonin signaling in peripheral tissues holds promise for 
      treating metabolic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis. Here, several benzimidazole derivatives have been identified as 
      novel agonists of the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2. The lead compounds 10b, 
      15a, and 19a demonstrated subnanomolar potency at MT1/MT2 receptors, high oral 
      bioavailability in rodents, peripherally preferred exposure, and excellent 
      selectivity in a broad panel of targets. Two-month oral administration of 10b in 
      high-fat diet rats led to a reduction in body weight gain similar to 
      dapagliflozin with superior results on hepatic steatosis and triglyceride levels. 
      An early toxicological assessment indicated that 10b (also codified as 
      ACH-000143) was devoid of hERG binding, genotoxicity, and behavioral alterations 
      at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o., supporting further investigation of this compound 
      as a drug candidate.

PG  - 618-25

AB  - For centuries, the kidney has been considered primarily an organ of elimination 
      and a regulator of salt and ion balance. Although once thought that the kidney 
      was the structural cause of diabetes, which in recent years has been ignored as a 
      regulator of glucose homeostasis, is now recognized as a major player in the 
      field of metabolic regulation carbohydrate. During fasting, 55% of the glucose 
      comes from gluconeogenesis. Only 2 organs have this capability: the liver and 
      kidney. The latter is responsible for 20% of total glucose production and 40% of 
      that produced by gluconeogenesis. Today we have a better understanding of the 
      physiology of renal glucose transport via specific transporters, such as type 2 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter&nbsp; (SGLT2). A natural compound, phlorizin, was 
      isolated in early 1800 and for decades played an important role in diabetes and 
      renal physiology research. Finally, at the nexus of these findings mentioned 
      above, recognized the effect of phlorizin-like compounds in the renal glucose 
      transporter, which has offered a new mechanism to treat hyperglycemia. This has 
      led to the development of several potentially effective treatment modalities for 
      the treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Different glucagon effects during DPP-4 inhibition versus SGLT-2 inhibition in 
      metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients.
PG  - 1652-1658
LID - 10.1111/dom.13276 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Previous studies have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibition 
      lowers glucagon levels whereas sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
      inhibition increases them. This study evaluated the extent of these opposite 
      effects in a direct comparative head-to-head study. METHODS: In a single-centre, 
      randomized study with a cross-over design, 28 metformin-treated patients with 
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) (mean age, 63 years; baseline HbA1c, 6.8%) were treated 
      with vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) for 2 
      weeks, with a 4-week wash-out period between the two separate treatments. After 
      each treatment period, a meal test was undertaken, with measurements of islet and 
      incretin hormones and 4-hour area under the curve (AUC) levels were estimated. 
      RESULTS: Fasting glucagon (35.6 ± 2.5 vs 39.4 ± 3.4 pmoL/L; P = .032) and 
      postprandial glucagon (4-hour AUC(glucagon) , 32.1 ± 2.3 vs 37.5 ± 2.7 nmoL/L 
      min; P = .001) were ~15% lower after vildagliptin compared to dapagliflozin 
      treatment. This was associated with stronger early (15 minute) C-peptide response 
      and higher 4-hour AUC(C-peptide) (P < .010), higher 4-hour AUC of the intact form 
      of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 
      (GLP-1) (P < .001) and lower 4-hour AUC of total GIP and GLP-1 (P < .001). 
      CONCLUSION: Treatment with DPP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin results in 15% 
      lower fasting and postprandial glucagon levels compared to SGLT-2 inhibition with 
      dapagliflozin. DPP-4 inhibition also induces more rapid insulin secretion and 
      higher levels of intact incretin hormones, resulting in stronger feedback 
      inhibition of incretin hormone secretion than SGLT-2 inhibition.

TI  - Effects of phosphate binders on the gastrointestinal absorption of arsenate and 
      of an SGLT2 inhibitor drug on the urinary excretion of arsenite in mice.

AB  - Arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) are typical sources of acute and chronic 
      arsenic poisoning. Therefore, reducing inner exposure to these arsenicals is a 
      rational objective. Because As(V) mimics phosphate, phosphate binder drugs may 
      decrease the intestinal As(V) absorption. Indeed, lanthanum and aluminium salts 
      and sevelamer removed As(V) from solution in vitro, especially at acidic pH. In 
      mice gavaged with As(V), lanthanum chloride, lanthanum carbonate and aluminium 
      hydroxide given orally also lowered the urinary excretion and tissue levels of 
      As(V) and its metabolites, indicating that they decreased the gastrointestinal 
      As(V) absorption. As some glucose transporters may carry As(III), the effect of 
      the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin was investigated in As(III)-injected mice. 
      While producing extreme glucosuria, dapagliflozin barely affected the urinary 
      excretion and tissue concentrations of As(III) and its metabolites. Thus, 
      phosphate binders (especially lanthanum compounds) can reduce the 
      gastrointestinal absorption of As(V); however, SGLT2 inhibition cannot diminish 
      the renal reabsorption of As(III).

TI  - A simple and rapid LC-MS/MS method for quantitation of luseogliflozin in rat 
      plasma and its application to a PK study.
PG  - 163-171
AB  - AIM: Luseogliflozin is a novel sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor 
      for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. To assist pharmacokinetic and 
      toxicodynamic studies, a rapid LC-MS/MS method were developed and validated for 
      the quantitation of luseogliflozin in rat plasma. RESULTS: Sample preparation was 
      carried out using simplified protein precipitation and liquid-liquid extraction 
      procedures, and the run time was only 4 min. Extraction recovery was 92.9 to 
      95.3%, and the method was validated over the range 0.5 to 500 ng/ml for 
      luseogliflozin with acceptable specificity, accuracy and precision. CONCLUSION: 
      The validated method is considered suitable to quantify luseogliflozin in 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic/toxicodynamic studies in rats.

TI  - In silico discovery of potential sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors from 
      natural products for treatment of heart failure via molecular docking and 
      molecular dynamics simulation approach.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is the end stage of cardiovascular disease. Because of its 
      complex condition and poor prognosis, HF has become an important public health 
      problem in the world. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) is a member of the 
      glucose transporter family. Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have been applied to treat 
      HF. In this study, the main aim was to discover natural SGLT2 inhibitor from 
      Chinese herbs through docking-based virtual screening. Totally 113 natural 
      compounds of potential SGLT2 inhibitor were identified, which displayed docking 
      affinity higher than six approved inhibitors (dapagliflozin (IC50 = 4.9 nM), 
      canagliflozin (IC50 = 4.4 nM 6.7), ipragliflozin (IC50 = 7.4 nM), empagliflozin 
      (IC50 = 3.1 nM), tofogliflozin (IC50 = 4 nM) and luseogliflozin (IC50 = 2.3 nM)) 
      through docking-based virtual screening. Then, the top three hits (ZINC70455591, 
      ZINC85594065 and ZINC14588133) and six known inhibitors were selected for 
      molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculation using 
      molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area to demonstrate the stability 
      and affinity of docked complexes. These results pointed out that the three docked 
      complexes were stabilized and the chosen compounds were tightly adhering to the 
      binding site of SGLT2. Besides, pharmacokinetic properties of the selected 
      compounds showed those natural compounds may be potential drug candidates. This 
      study may be contributed to further in vitro and in vivo validation and the 
      development of novel SGLT2 inhibitor for treating HF.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Susceptibility to serious skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and skin tissue 
      distribution of sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors.
PG  - 937-943
LID - 10.7150/ijms.22224 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: In Japan, sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
      have been reported to be associated with serious skin and subcutaneous tissue 
      disorders. A post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study suggested that the 
      association was specific for ipragliflozin and, to a lesser extent for 
      dapagliflozin. These studies were performed to confirm the association of 6 SGLT2 
      inhibitors with serious skin disorders in a clinical setting, to elucidate the 
      role of melanin in serious skin disorders and to understand the underlying 
      mechanisms. Methods: The latest PMS records were retrieved from the Japanese 
      Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, and the associations were analyzed by 
      data mining techniques. In silico 3-D docking simulation of SGLT2 inhibitors with 
      melanin was performed using the MOE software. The skin tissue distribution of 
      SGLT2 inhibitors was evaluated using albino rats after oral administration at 
      clinical doses. Results: The adjusted reporting odds ratio (95% confidential 
      limit) was 1.667 (1.415, 1.963) for ipragliflozin, 0.514 (0.317, 0.835) for 
      dapagliflozin, 0.149 (0.048, 0.465) for tofogliflozin, 0.624 (0.331, 1.177) for 
      luseogliflozin, 0.590 (0.277, 1.257) for canagliflozin and 0.293 (0.073, 1.187) 
      for empagliflozin, when drugs other than the SGLT2 inhibitors were referred, and 
      the association was detected only for ipragliflozin in clinical use. In silico 
      3-D docking simulation suggested the influence of melanin in 
      ipragliflozin-specific serious skin disorders. The skin tissue-to-plasma 
      concentration ratio of ipragliflozin was 0.45 ± 0.20 (±SD) at 1 hr after 
      administration and increased in a time-dependent manner to 5.82 ± 3.66 at 24 hr 
      (p<0.05), but not in case of other SGLT2 inhibitors. Conclusions: Serious skin 
      disorders were suggested to be specific for ipragliflozin. Interaction with 
      melanin might be implicated in ipragliflozin-specific serious skin disorders. 
      Ipragliflozin was retained in the skin tissue, which suggested its interaction 
      with the skin tissue in serious skin disorders.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic model of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition: 
      implications for quantitative translational pharmacology.
PG  - 576-84
LID - 10.1208/s12248-011-9297-2 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an emerging class of 
      agents for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Inhibition of 
      SGLT2 leads to improved glycemic control through increased urinary glucose 
      excretion (UGE). In this study, a biologically based 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated UGE was 
      developed. The derived model was used to characterize the acute PK/PD 
      relationship of the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, in rats. The quantitative 
      translational pharmacology of dapagliflozin was examined through both prospective 
      simulation and direct modeling of mean literature data obtained for dapagliflozin 
      in healthy subjects. Prospective simulations provided time courses of UGE that 
      were of consistent shape to clinical observations, but were modestly biased 
      toward under prediction. Direct modeling provided an improved characterization of 
      the data and precise parameter estimates which were reasonably consistent with 
      those predicted from preclinical data. Overall, these results indicate that the 
      acute clinical pharmacology of SGLT2 inhibitors in healthy subjects can be 
      reasonably well predicted from preclinical data through rational accounting of 
      species differences in pharmacokinetics, physiology, and SGLT2 pharmacology. 
      Because these data can be generated at the earliest stages of drug discovery, the 
      proposed model is useful in the design and development of novel SGLT2 inhibitors. 
      In addition, this model is expected to serve as a useful foundation for future 
      efforts to understand and predict the effects of SGLT2 inhibition under chronic 
      administration and in other patient populations.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Empagliflozin in Healthy Egyptian Volunteers Using 
      LC-MS/MS and Comparison with Other Ethnic Populations.

AB  - The present study considered the pharmacokinetic evaluation of empagliflozin 
      after administration to Egyptian volunteers, and the results were compared with 
      other ethnic populations. The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining 
      racial subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies 
      and to assess potential subgroup differences. The design of the study was as an 
      open labeled, randomized, one treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic 
      study. The main pharmacokinetic parameters estimated were C(max), T(max), t(1/2), 
      elimination rate constant, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf). The insignificant difference 
      in pharmacokinetic parameters between Egyptians and white German subjects 
      suggests that no dose adjustment should be considered with administration of 
      25 mg empagliflozin to Egyptian population. A new LC-MS/MS method was developed 
      and validated, allowing sensitive estimation of empagliflozin (25-600 ng mL(-1)) 
      in human plasma using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). The method was 
      applied successfully on the underlying pharmacokinetic study with enhanced sample 
      preparation that involved liquid-liquid extraction. Multiple Reaction Monitoring 
      (MRM) of the transition pairs of m/z 449.01 to 371.21 for empagliflozin and m/z 
      407.00 to 328.81 for dapagliflozin (IS) was employed utilizing negative mode 
      Electro Spray Ionization (ESI). The validated LC-MS/MS method is suitable for 
      further toxicodynamic and bioequivalence studies.

TI  - A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Kidney Model of Diabetes Associated Renal 
      Hyperfiltration and the Effects of SGLT Inhibitors.
PG  - 788-797
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12359 [doi]
AB  - The early stage of diabetes mellitus is characterized by increased glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR), known as hyperfiltration, which is believed to be one of 
      the main causes leading to renal injury in diabetes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 
      2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to be able to reverse hyperfiltration in 
      some patients. We developed a mechanistic computational model of the kidney that 
      explains the interplay of hyperglycemia and hyperfiltration and integrates the 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of the SGLT2i dapagliflozin. Based on 
      simulation results, we propose kidney growth as the necessary process for 
      hyperfiltration progression. Further, the model indicates that renal SGLT1i could 
      significantly improve hyperfiltration when added to SGTL2i. Integrated into a 
      physiologically based PK/PD (PBPK/PD) Diabetes Platform, the model presents a 
      powerful tool for aiding drug development, prediction of hyperfiltration risk, 
      and allows the assessment of the outcomes of individualized treatments with 
      SGLT1-inhibitors and SGLT2-inhibitors and their co-administration with insulin.

TI  - New spectrofluorimetric analysis of dapagliflozin after derivatization with 
      NBD-Cl in human plasma using factorial design experiments.
PG  - 576-584
LID - 10.1002/bio.3640 [doi]
AB  - A new validated spectrofluorimetric method was proposed for dapagliflozin (DGF) 
      analysis in bulk, plexin its commercially available tablets and in spiked human 
      plasma. The proposed spectrofluorimetric method depended on the formation of a 
      fluorescent complex soluble in organic liquids by a substitution reaction between 
      4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) reagent and DGF in aqueous 
      buffered solution at pH 7. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 522 nm 
      after excitation at 453 nm. The high selectivity of the proposed method allowed 
      analysis of DGF in dosage form and human plasma samples with average recovery 
      values of 99.84 ± 1.38% and 98.71 ± 1.80%, respectively, without any interference 
      from matrix components. The calibration range was 50-1000 ng ml(-1) . The limit 
      of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 14.24 ng ml(-1) and 
      43.14 ng ml(-1) , respectively. The estimated relative standard deviation values 
      were lower than 2.0%, this showed the excellent precision at both levels. 
      Factorial design was used to get the optimum method conditions for the analysis 
      of the resulting DGF fluorescence complex in different matrices. The proposed 
      method could be used in routine analysis of DGF in quality control laboratories. 
      Also, it could be used to assay DGF in human plasma and be applied for 
      pharmacokinetic investigation of DGF.

AB  - Sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition has been 
      demonstrated to efficiently control hyperglycemia via an insulin 
      secretion-independent pathway. The unique mode of action eliminates the risk of 
      hypoglycemia and makes SGLT2 inhibitors an attractive option for the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes. In a continuation of our previous studies on SGLT2 inhibitors 
      bearing different sugar moieties, sixteen new N-glucosyl indole derivatives were 
      designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against 
      hSGLT2. Of these sixteen, acethydrazide-containing N-glucosyl indole 9d was found 
      to be the most potent SGLT2 inhibitor, and caused a significant elevation in 
      urine glucose excretion in rats at 50 mg/kg, relative to the vehicle control.

TI  - Physiologically based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling to predict 
      concentrations and actions of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 inhibitor 
      canagliflozin in human intestines and renal tubules.
PG  - 491-506
LID - 10.1002/bdd.2040 [doi]
AB  - Canagliflozin is a recently developed sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 
      inhibitor that promotes renal glucose excretion and is considered to inhibit 
      renal SGLT2 from the luminal side of proximal tubules. Canagliflozin reportedly 
      inhibits SGLT1 weakly and suppresses postprandial plasma glucose, suggesting that 
      it also inhibits intestinal SGLT1. However, it is difficult to measure the drug 
      concentrations of these assumed sites of action directly. The 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of canagliflozin remain 
      poorly characterized. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
      model of canagliflozin was developed based on clinical data from healthy 
      volunteers and it was used to simulate luminal concentrations in intestines and 
      renal tubules. In small intestine simulations, the inhibition ratios for SGLT1 
      were predicted to be 40%-60% after the oral administration of clinical doses 
      (100-300 mg/day). In contrast, inhibition ratios of canagliflozin for renal SGLT2 
      and SGLT1 were predicted to be approximately 100% and 0.2%-0.4%, respectively. 
      These analyses suggest that canagliflozin only inhibits SGLT2 in the kidney. 
      Using the simulated proximal tubule luminal concentrations of canagliflozin, the 
      urinary glucose excretion rates in canagliflozin-treated diabetic patients were 
      accurately predicted using the renal glucose reabsorption model as a PD model. 
      Because the simulation of canagliflozin pharmacokinetics was successful, this 
      PBPK methodology was further validated by successfully simulating the 
      pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin, another SGLT2 inhibitor. The present results 
      suggest the utility of this PBPK/PD model for predicting canagliflozin 
      concentrations at target sites and help to elucidate the pharmacological effects 
      of SGLT1/2 inhibition in humans. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Treatment of hyperglycemia with drugs that block renal glucose reabsorption via 
      inhibition of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is a novel 
      approach to diabetes management. In this study, twenty-seven aryl C-glycosides 
      bearing a C=N/C-N linkage at the glucosyl C6 position were designed, synthesized 
      and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against human SGLT2 (hSGLT2). 
      Compounds with good hSGLT2 inhibition were further investigated to determine 
      their selectivity over hSGLT1. Of these, five representative aryl C-glycosides 
      were chosen for pharmacokinetic analysis. Oxime 2a was determined to have the 
      most promising pharmacokinetic properties and was selected for in vivo glucosuria 
      and plasma glucose level studies, which found it to exhibit comparable efficacy 
      to dapagliflozin (1). Furthermore, 2a was not found to exhibit either significant 
      cytotoxicity (CC(50) > 50 μM) or human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) 
      inhibition (2% inhibition at 10 μM). Taken together, these efforts culminated in 
      the discovery of oxime 2a as a potential SGLT2 inhibitor.

AB  - A series of highly active C-aryl glucoside SGLT2 inhibitors containing a biphenyl 
      motif were designed and synthesized for biological evaluation. Among the 
      compounds tested, compound 16l demonstrated high inhibitory activity against 
      SGLT2 (IC50=1.9 nM) with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile. Further study 
      indicated that the in vivo efficacy of compound 16l was comparable to that of 
      dapagliflozin, suggesting that further development would be worthwhile.

TI  - Why Do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30-50% of renal glucose reabsorption in 
      humans?
PG  - 2199-204
LID - 10.2337/db12-0052 [doi]
AB  - Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a novel and promising 
      treatment for diabetes under late-stage clinical development. It generally is 
      accepted that SGLT2 mediates 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 
      inhibitors in clinical development inhibit only 30-50% of the filtered glucose 
      load. Why are they unable to inhibit 90% of glucose reabsorption in humans? We 
      will try to provide an explanation to this puzzle in this perspective analysis of 
      the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors in 
      clinical trials and examine possible mechanisms and molecular properties that may 
      be responsible.

AB  - In this study a sensitive UHPLC-QTOF-MS method was developed and validated for 
      the quantitation of the metformin (MET) and teneligliptin (TEN) in rat plasma 
      using dapagliflozin as an internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation were 
      carried out on a Acquity UPLC HSS Cyano column (100mm x 2.1mm, 1.8μm) using 
      gradient mobile phase system consisting of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile at a 
      flow rate of 0.4mL/min, within a run time of 6min. Protein precipitation method 
      was used as sample preparation approach. Detection of target ions [M+H](+) at m/z 
      130.1085 for MET, m/z 427.2277 for TEN and m/z 409.1623 for IS was performed at 
      positive ion electrospray ionization mode. Linearity was assessed in the range of 
      0.98-1000ng/mL for both MET and TEN. The developed assay was validated as per 
      US-FDA and EMA bioanalytical guidelines and successfully applied to 
      pharmacokinetic interaction study in SD rats. A 1.1 fold increment in the AUC 
      levels of MET and TEN was observed when co-administered together in rats.

TI  - [Dapagliflozin. Lowering blood glucose levels by increasing glucosuria].
PG  - 128-32
AB  - The antidiabetic drug dapagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by a novel 
      mechanism: It increases the excretion of glucose via the kidneys. In clinical 
      trials, HbA1c decreased by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points if dapagliflozin was 
      administered either in monotherapy or combined with other antidiabetic drugs. 
      Common side effects are infections of the urogenital system. It is still unclear 
      why patients in clinical trials suffered more often from cancer. Especially 
      bladder cancer could be observed. However, the increase of cancer cases was not 
      statistically significant. In contrast to the European Medicines Agency, the FDA 
      has not yet approved dapagliflozin for safety reasons.

TI  - Mechanistic evaluation of the effect of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 
      inhibitors on delayed glucose absorption in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus using a quantitative systems pharmacology model of human systemic 
      glucose dynamics.
PG  - 352-366
LID - 10.1002/bdd.2253 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) 2 is specifically expressed in the 
      kidney, while SGLT1 is present in the kidneys and small intestine. SGLT2 
      inhibitors are a class of oral antidiabetic drugs that lower elevated plasma 
      glucose levels by promoting the urinary excretion of excess glucose through the 
      inhibition of renal glucose reuptake. The inhibition selectivity for SGLT2 over 
      SGLT1 (SGLT2/1 selectivity) of marketed SGLT2 inhibitors is diverse, while 
      SGLT2/1 selectivity of canagliflozin is relatively low. Although canagliflozin 
      suppresses postprandial glucose levels, the degree of contribution for SGLT1 
      inhibition to this effect remains unproven. To analyze the effect of SGLT2 
      inhibitors on postprandial glucose level, we constructed a novel quantitative 
      systems pharmacology (QSP) model, called human systemic glucose dynamics (HSGD) 
      model, integrating intestinal absorption, metabolism, and renal reabsorption of 
      glucose. This HSGD model reproduced the postprandial plasma glucose 
      concentration-time profiles during a meal tolerance test under different clinical 
      trial conditions. Simulations after canagliflozin administration showed a 
      dose-dependent delay of time (T(max,glc) ) to reach maximum concentration of 
      glucose (C(max,glc) ), and the delay of T(max,glc) disappeared when inhibition of 
      SGLT1 was negated. In addition, contribution ratio of intestinal SGLT1 inhibition 
      to the decrease in C(max,glc) was estimated to be 23%-28%, when 100 and 300 mg of 
      canagliflozin are administered. This HSGD model enabled us to provide the partial 
      contribution of intestinal SGLT1 inhibition to the improvement of postprandial 
      hyperglycemia as well as to quantitatively describe the plasma glucose dynamics 
      following SGLT2 inhibitors.
